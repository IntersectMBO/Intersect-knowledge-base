# Voltaire

Voltaire is the fifth building phase of Cardano development in the original roadmap. Voltaire will continue the transformation of the Cardano network to a self-sustaining system, pioneering a new standard for community-driven governance in blockchain technology.&#x20;

Once implemented, the Cardano community will be empowered with new tools to continue driving the decision-making and steering of Cardano. A Constitution will provide the framework and guardrails for collective decision-making.
