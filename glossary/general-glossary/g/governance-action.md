# Governance action

A governance action is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction. Governance actions have an expiration period, after which the action cannot be enacted.&#x20;

Any ada holder can submit a governance action for a vote on-chain. Once the action is recorded on the ledger, voters submit voting transactions. A governance action will be enacted once it is ratified (see below).&#x20;

CIP-1694 defines seven different governance actions:

1\. Motion of no-confidence

2\. New constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or term limits

3\. Updates to the Constitution

4\. Hard fork initiation

5\. Protocol parameter changes

6\. Treasury withdrawals

7\. Information
