# Constitutional Committee

The Constitutional Committee (CC) is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694 alongside SPOs and DReps. CIP-1694 defines the CC as a committee representing a set of individuals or entities collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution's principles are upheld and enforced.

CC members may vote on any governance action and decide if it goes against the Constitution. The CC cannot modify governance actions once presented for a vote. The CC will be initially instituted for the first interaction with members of the Cardano community and evolve as the governance model advances. &#x20;
