# Cardano Improvement Proposal

A [Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP)](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip1) is a technical document that proposes changes, ideas, or enhancements to the Cardano blockchain, its processes, or its environment.&#x20;

CIPs are intended as the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting design decisions implemented on Cardano. Because CIPs are text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of significant changes affecting Cardano.&#x20;
