# Constitution

A constitution is a collection of rules for a state that determines the fundamental principles by which a state is governed. Throughout history, constitutions have played a key role in establishing and delineating a Government’s structural framework, defining the main institutions of the state and their respective powers, responsibilities, and limitations. A constitution provides the framework for decision-making and typically incorporates design features that should reduce decision-making costs at scale.&#x20;

As Cardano is a community-led ecosystem, it is imperative that its Constitution is enacted for the benefit and protection of the entire ecosystem.&#x20;

The Cardano Constitution will provide the framework and guardrails for collective decision-making. It will also define the rights and principles for those participating in the Cardano ecosystem and provide the foundation to meet the current and future demands of a maturing ecosystem (see also Interim Constitution).

Ada holders must ratify the Constitution, an act of solidarity to protect and ensure the health of the Cardano ecosystem.
