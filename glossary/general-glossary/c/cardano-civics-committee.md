The Cardano Civics Committee, one of the committees forming at Intersect, will help orchestrate community activities to steer the Constitutional process throughout 2024 toward the goal of community ratification at a Constitutional Convention later that year. Additionally, the Civics Committee may support a larger governance remit by providing transparency and recommendations.
