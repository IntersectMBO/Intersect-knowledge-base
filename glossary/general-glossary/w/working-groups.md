# Working groups

A working group brings together experts and committed community members around one specific topic of discussion. For example, at Intersect, working groups typically roll up to a committee. Each group sets its own goals regarding solutions to drive ecosystem success and adoption going forward.&#x20;

Intersect is currently facilitating the creation and bootstrapping of these expert groups. The ultimate goal is community empowerment to self-mobilize and collaborate on decision-making processes and solution implementation.
