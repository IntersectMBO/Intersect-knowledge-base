# Project Catalyst

[Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) is the world’s largest decentralized innovation engine for solving real-world challenges. Catalyst was set up in 2020, and within two years, 30,000 members had set hundreds of projects underway with a treasury worth $1 billion ada. The project marked the start of Cardano’s Voltaire phase and is one of the world’s largest examples of on-chain governance. Project Catalyst’s most recent fund, Fund10, saw over 40K votes cast to distribute 50m ada to projects building in the ecosystem.

Catalyst is currently the vehicle for community members to access Cardano treasury funding. Its role will continue to evolve as CIP-1694 opens up Cardano treasury withdrawal governance actions.
