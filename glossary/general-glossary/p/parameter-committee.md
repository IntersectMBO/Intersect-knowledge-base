# Parameter Committee

The Parameter Committee will be one of the standing committees under Intersect. Initially being bootstrapped by IOG, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation with members of the stake pool operator (SPO) community, the committee will issue non-binding recommendations for the parameters of the Cardano protocol, and discuss all protocol parameters including network, technical, and economic parameters.
