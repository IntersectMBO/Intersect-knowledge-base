## About Intersect

Intersect empowers a distributed network of builders and contributors to share in the belief that every voice holds value and that building together is stronger. Members forge a secure, collaborative ecosystem to ensure Cardano's sustained growth and evolution in a safe space. Intersect and its members play an important role in shaping the proposed on-chain governance mechanisms - and the development of off-chain tools and processes to support it, including the rollout of Cardano’s first Constitution. During 2024, the drafting process and ratification of Cardano’s Constitution will take place, involving thousands of participants across the world.&#x20;

## The Role

We are seeking a highly motivated and experienced Community Engagement Manager to join our team on a nine month full-time contract. During this important period of growth and development for the Cardano ecosystem, this role will be pivotal in supporting the consultation period for Cardano's constitution - a foundational activity that will shape the future of the network for all ada holders. As the Community Engagement Manager, you will lead our efforts to ensure broad and meaningful participation from the Cardano community during the consultation process. The consultation process will include a series of global workshops hosted by community members. The workshops will debate and evolve the draft constitution as well as select a delegate to attend the convention. At the year end, there will be a constitutional convention and on-chain vote for ada holders to ratify the final text.

This role will act as the point of contact for the Constitution workshop hosts and convention delegates to provide prompt, accurate and supportive information so they can confidently participate. Responsibilities begin in the workshop application process, through delegate campaigns until the Constitution is ratified on-chain. In addition, through social media and community spaces, you will nurture key relationships, support the Civics Committee within Intersect, and support the Intersect community & communication teams more broadly to promote inclusion and accessibility throughout the Cardano ecosystem during the consultation process.
