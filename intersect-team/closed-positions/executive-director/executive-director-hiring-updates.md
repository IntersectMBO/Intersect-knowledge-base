## Tuesday November 4, 2025&#x20;

Following the close of both the Member and DRep polls last Friday, a small group of candidates have now been shortlisted to progress to the panel interview stage. These interviews will include a panel consisting of staff of Intersect, Intersect’s Board, and the Steering Committee. The shortlisted candidates collectively represent a mix of community representation, key skills and strategic outlook, providing a well-rounded field for the interview panel to assess across operational, governance, and cultural fit. You can learn more about the hiring process within Intersect's knowledge base, [here](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-team/open-positions/executive-director/executive-director-recruitment-process).

We want to reiterate that this was a poll, not a vote for candidate offer. It's purpose was to provide directional insights for Intersect and the Board and has not determined who will receive an offer at this current stage of the hiring process. Candidate profiles were redacted in line with employment law and global data privacy obligations and any candidates who have publicly shared their own participation did so at their own discretion, not under instruction from Intersect. While the redacted candidate profiles may have limited participants’ ability to fully evaluate prior achievements and leadership scop&#x65;_,_ we did receive very good insight on the kinds of qualities and experiences that the community is looking for in candidates. Final selections for panel interviews therefore combine community poll insights with the initial shortlisting criteria, including leadership readiness, ecosystem understanding, and the diversity of perspective this role requires.

Thank you to everyone who participated and shared constructive feedback during this stage of the hiring proces&#x73;_,_ especially as we operated under a tight timeline to provide a fair process for the search candidates. We recognise that this is a nuanced and community-facing hiring process, and at times it may look and feel different to traditional recruitment, and the election polls the community are used to. Your engagement is invaluable as we continue to evolve these practices.

The next update from Intersect will be the announcement of the appointed Executive Director in the coming weeks. For any questions or feedback in the meantime, please contact us directly at [careers@intersectmbo.org](mailto:careers@intersectmbo.org).\
