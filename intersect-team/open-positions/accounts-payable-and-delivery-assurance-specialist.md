## Overview

Intersect MBO is the member-based organization that underpins Cardanoâ€™s decentralized governance. Formed to ensure that the Cardano ecosystem remains community-led and self-sustaining, Intersect acts as both a convenor and enabler - connecting developers, Delegated Representatives (DReps), project teams, and members to shape the blockchainâ€™s future collectively.

Through its committees, working groups, and open membership model, Intersect develops governance frameworks, coordinates ecosystem initiatives, and supports transparency across technical, strategic, and financial domains. Intersect operates independently of IOG, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation, while collaborating closely with them to deliver on Cardanoâ€™s long-term vision.

At its core, Intersect is about community governance in action, giving the people who build and use Cardano the power to guide its direction.
