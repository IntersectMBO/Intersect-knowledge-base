## Overview

Intersect is the member-based governance organization at the heart of the Cardano ecosystem. As the decentralized landscape continues to evolve, we seek an Executive Director (ED) who embodies the principles of transparency, decentralization, and inclusive community stewardship. This is not a traditional executive role, the ED of Intersect is first and foremost a facilitator and enabler of community-driven progress.

We are looking for a candidate with strong leadership and operational acumen, paired with an unwavering commitment to open governance, Web3 values, and collaborative ecosystem-building. The ideal candidate will possess experience leading diverse, distributed teams and be capable of driving measurable outcomes in a highly transparent and community-oriented environment.

## Key Responsibilities

### Strategic Leadership & Community Engagement

* Champion Intersect's mission by developing and implementing a member-aligned strategy.
* Serve as a public-facing leader of Intersect, present at community forums, governance discussions, and global ecosystem events.
* Foster a culture of transparency, accountability, and open dialogue within the organization and community.
* Collaborate with independent consortiums, governance coalitions, and other MBOs active in the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.
* Act as a neutral facilitator of governance decisions, prioritizing the voices of Intersect members, committees, and stakeholders involved with Cardano Governance.

### Operational Management

* Oversee day-to-day operations and execution of strategic initiatives across working groups and core programs in partnership with membership committees and Intersect staff.
* Develop and implement scalable, decentralized systems and processes to improve transparency and organizational responsiveness.
* Maintain risk, legal, compliance, and financial oversight in accordance with best practices and member expectations.

### Governance and Stakeholder Relations

Build trusted relationships with Intersect members, technical and strategic committees, and ecosystem entities such as Cardano Foundation, IOG, EMURGO, and others.

* Work closely with the Board to implement member resolutions, develop new governance tools, and refine the organizational structure.
* Ensure committee charters are respected and facilitate cross-committee coordination without overstepping the legal authority of the board.
* Inspire and recruit stakeholders from the Cardano community to join the organization and contribute to it.

### People & Culture

* Build, mentor, and retain a globally distributed executive team and operational staff.
* Promote diverse viewpoints, individual empowerment, and cultural intelligence across the organization.
* Foster a culture of service, collaboration, and decentralization, consistent with community values.

### Finance & Resource Management

* Ensure fiscal responsibility in managing the MBO budget and resource allocation.
* Lead transparent budgeting and reporting processes in collaboration with the Board.
* Explore ecosystem-aligned funding opportunities and partnership development.

## Qualifications & Attributes

### Minimum Requirements

* Demonstrated senior leadership experience in decentralized systems, non-governmental organizations, foundations, or member-based entities, with a proven track record of leading complex initiatives, teams, or organizations in mission-driven environments.
* Strong track record of operational delivery, organizational leadership, and working with complex, multi-stakeholder communities.
* Demonstrated alignment with Web3 values, decentralization principles, and community-led governance.
* Proven ability to work in transparent, high-accountability environments.
* Outstanding interpersonal, communication, and facilitation skills across distributed, diverse teams.
* Strategic planning experience with a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities of MBO structures.

## Preferred Attributes

* Expertise in conflict resolution, community management, and grassroots engagement strategies.
* Prior leadership or governance experience in a nonprofit network, or digital cooperative.
* Familiarity with the Cardano blockchain ecosystem or experience participating in blockchain governance ecosystems.
* Experience working across cultures, geographies, and with emerging market communities.
* Comfortable balancing legal, fiduciary, and mission-aligned responsibilities within a decentralized structure.

### Performance & Accountability

* A public-facing performance dashboard will be used to track quarterly goals and organizational progress.
* The ED is subject to quarterly review by the board and must participate in community update calls.
* The ED serves a 2-year term, renewable upon board and community consultation.
* A 90-day probation period will apply, with structured performance evaluation.\
