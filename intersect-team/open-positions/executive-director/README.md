## Overview

Intersect MBO is the member-based organisation that underpins Cardano‚Äôs decentralised governance. Formed to ensure that the Cardano ecosystem remains community-led and self-sustaining, Intersect acts as both a convenor and enabler - connecting developers, Delegated Representatives (DReps), project teams, and members to shape the blockchain‚Äôs future collectively.

Through its committees, working groups, and open membership model, Intersect develops governance frameworks, coordinates ecosystem initiatives, and supports transparency across technical, strategic, and financial domains. Intersect operates independently of IOG, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation, while collaborating closely with them to deliver on Cardano‚Äôs long-term vision.

At its core, Intersect is about community governance in action, giving the people who build and use Cardano the power to guide its direction.

## The Role

As the decentralised landscape continues to evolve, we seek an Executive Director (ED) who embodies the principles of transparency, decentralisation, and inclusive community stewardship

This is not a traditional executive role: the Executive Director of Intersect is first and foremost a facilitator and enabler of community-driven progress. We are looking for a candidate with strong leadership and operational acumen, paired with an unwavering commitment to open governance, Web3 values, and collaborative ecosystem-building. The ideal candidate will possess experience leading diverse, distributed teams and be capable of driving measurable outcomes in a highly transparent and community-oriented environment.

## Key Responsibilities

### Strategic Leadership & Community Engagement

* Champion Intersect's mission by developing and implementing a member-aligned strategy.
* Serve as a public-facing leader of Intersect, present at community forums, governance discussions, and global ecosystem events.
* Foster a culture of transparency, accountability, and open dialogue within the Intersect and the community.
* Collaborate with independent consortiums, governance coalitions, and other MBOs active in the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.
* Act as a neutral facilitator of governance decisions, prioritising the voices of Intersect members, committees, and stakeholders involved with Cardano Governance.

### Operational Management

* Oversee day-to-day operations and execution of strategic initiatives across working groups and core programs in partnership with membership committees and Intersect staff.
* Work closely with the Director of Operations and Head of People & Culture to ensure organizational systems, resourcing, and culture enable effective delivery and alignment with Intersect‚Äôs strategic goals.
* Develop and implement scalable, decentralized systems and processes to improve transparency and organizational responsiveness.
* Maintain risk, legal, compliance, and financial oversight in accordance with best practices and member expectations.

### Governance and Stakeholder Relations

Build trusted relationships with Intersect members, technical and strategic committees, and ecosystem entities such as Cardano Foundation, IOG, EMURGO, and others.

* Work closely with the Board to implement member resolutions, develop new governance tools, and refine the organisational structure.
* Ensure committee charters are respected and facilitate cross-committee coordination without overstepping the legal authority of the board.
* Inspire and recruit stakeholders from the Cardano community to join the organization and contribute to it.

### People & Culture

* Build, mentor, and retain a globally distributed executive team and operational staff.
* Promote diverse viewpoints, individual empowerment, and cultural intelligence across the organisation.
* Foster a culture of service, collaboration, and decentralisation, consistent with community values.

### Finance & Resource Management

* Ensure fiscal responsibility in managing the MBO budget and resource allocation.
* Lead transparent budgeting and reporting processes in collaboration with the Board.
* Explore ecosystem-aligned funding opportunities and partnership development.

## Measuring Success

The Executive Director‚Äôs performance will be guided by transparent and measurable outcomes. A public-facing dashboard will track quarterly goals and organisational progress, supporting community visibility and accountability. The ED will participate in quarterly performance reviews with the Board and provide regular updates to the community through scheduled calls. The role carries a two-year renewable term, subject to review by both the Board and the community, and begins with a structured 90-day probation period to ensure mutual alignment and success

* Demonstrated alignment with Web3 values, decentralisation principles, and community-led governance.
* Proven ability to work in transparent, high-accountability environments.

* Experience working across cultures, geographies, and with emerging market communities.
* Comfortable balancing legal, fiduciary, and mission-aligned responsibilities within a decentralized structure.
