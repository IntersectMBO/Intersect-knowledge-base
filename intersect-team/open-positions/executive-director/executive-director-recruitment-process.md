# Executive Director - Recruitment process

{% hint style="warning" %}
All dates here might be adjusted based on amount of candidates.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Applications and Nominations

Candidates may apply directly or be nominated by a Member or DRep. All submissions will be reviewed by Intersect’s Head of People & Culture to confirm eligibility and shortlist candidates who meet the criteria outlined in the job description.

**Applications and nominations are open from Monday October 6, 2025 and will close on Friday October 24, 2025.**&#x20;

Note: By applying or accepting a nomination, candidates consent to limited sharing of their profiles with Intersect Members, DReps, and the Board during shortlisting and polling.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Shortlisting

The shortlisting stage is led by Intersect’s head of people and culture to ensure a consistent and fair review of all executive director applications. This stage helps identify candidates who best align with the skills, experience, and values required for the role before redacted profiles are shared for Member and DRep polling. The approach balances professional suitability with openness to diverse leadership backgrounds, reflecting Intersect’s commitment to transparency and equitable participation in governance.&#x20;

Shortlisting will consider both comparable executive experience and relevant ecosystem or governance backgrounds. We’ll be looking for individuals who can operate at the intersection of strategic leadership and community representation - capable of running a complex organization while embodying Intersect’s decentralized values.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Members and DReps polling

Intersect is a member-based organization serving the Cardano community. Therefore, both Members and DReps will have the opportunity to review shortlisted profiles and vote via separate polls:

* Member Poll: one-member-one-vote
* DRep Poll: weighted by DRep stake

Candidate profiles presented in polling will be redacted for personal data and presented with identical structure and length to ensure fairness. Candidates will be asked to record a short video which will be submitted with their profile for polling. You can learn more about how candidate data is shared by viewing our [Candidate Privacy Policy](../../../legal/policies-and-conditions/candidate-privacy-policy.md).&#x20;

**Polling will run from Monday October 27, 2025 to Friday October 31, 2025 and will determine the candidates to advance to panel interviews.**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Pre Panel Context Call

Before the formal panel interview, shortlisted candidates will be invited to a thirty minute context call with Intersect’s head of people and culture and director of operations.  This call is not part of the assessment process - its purpose is to ensure every candidate has the same opportunity to:

* Understand Intersect’s structure, governance model, and current priorities;
* Ask questions about the organization, role expectations, or culture; and
* Gain clarity on the upcoming panel interview format and case-study exercise.

Each candidate will receive the same briefing and opportunity to ask questions. Notes from these calls are used only to ensure process consistency, not for evaluation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Panel interviews

During November 2025, independent panel interviews will select finalists based on a structured scoring system. The interview may require a short candidate presentation and will include both competency and behavioural based questions.&#x20;

&#x20;Panel composition:

* 2 Board representatives
* 2 Member representatives (elected Steering Committee)
* 2 Intersect staff&#x20;

Interview questions and scoring will focus on:

* Leadership and governance experience
* Alignment with Intersect’s mission and community ethos
* Operational and strategic capability in decentralized environments
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Board selection

The Intersect Board of Directors will review the panel’s report and select a final candidate for offer and contract negotiation.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If no suitable candidate is identified, the Board may decide to re-open applications with revisions, if necessary.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Transparency and Data Protection

All applicant data will be stored securely and processed in line with GDPR. Consent to share candidate summaries for Member/DRep polling will be collected via the Typeform application form.&#x20;
