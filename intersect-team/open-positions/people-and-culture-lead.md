### Key responsibilities

* Support leadership in designing career progression pathways and professional development opportunities, helping staff grow their skills and contributions.
* Champion employee engagement and wellbeing, ensuring every team member has the support to succeed.
* Lead recruitment efforts, from crafting role descriptions to onboarding, to attract diverse and mission-aligned talent.
* Act as a trusted advisor to the leadership team on people and organizational health.
* Support managers with guidance on team dynamics, employee relations, and performance.
* Partner with leadership to strengthen organizational structure and ways of working.
* Champion diversity, equity, and inclusion in all people processes.
* Maintain compliance with employment law and HR best practices across jurisdictions.

### About you

* Strong understanding of culture building and organizational dynamics.
* Skilled in designing and delivering career progression frameworks and professional development initiatives.
* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to build trust across all levels.
* Comfortable balancing strategic thinking and hands-on delivery.
* HR qualification (CIPD, SHRM, or equivalent) is highly desirable.
* Alignment with servant-leadership principles and understanding of how to empower members rather than direct them.
* Knowledge of Cardano and its ecosystem is a significant advantage.

### Why join Intersect?
