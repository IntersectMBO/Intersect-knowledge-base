## Overview

Intersect MBO is the member-based organization that underpins Cardanoâ€™s decentralized governance. Formed to ensure that the Cardano ecosystem remains community-led and self-sustaining, Intersect acts as both a convenor and enabler - connecting developers, Delegated Representatives (DReps), project teams, and members to shape the blockchainâ€™s future collectively.

Through its committees, working groups, and open membership model, Intersect develops governance frameworks, coordinates ecosystem initiatives, and supports transparency across technical, strategic, and financial domains. Intersect operates independently of IOG, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation, while collaborating closely with them to deliver on Cardanoâ€™s long-term vision.

At its core, Intersect is about community governance in action, giving the people who build and use Cardano the power to guide its direction.

## The Role

we are seeking an experienced Security Incident Officer to drive the evaluation and development of security process offerings across our organization interfacing to the Cardano blockchain.  Reporting to the Head of the Open Source Office and forging close working relationships with the Security Council and technical committees at Intersect, this role will coordinate incident response procedures, engage with developers and community stakeholders, and support network resilience through monitoring, facilitating response drills, and secure software practices.

This is a key role for someone passionate about decentralization, blockchain analysis and security. You will work closely with our members across the Security Council, Technical Steering Committee, and Open Source Committee to evaluate and implement the initial stages of decentralized security tooling and processes on behalf of the MBO. &#x20;

## Key Responsibilities:&#x20;
