# Intersect committees

Intersect is designed to be steered by its members, ensuring Cardano's future is community-led. Elected members provide this direction through standing committees, where they take an active role in shaping Cardano's development.

Intersect has seven standing committees and a steering committee made up of the chairs of the other seven. These committees handle specialized areas like civics, membership and community, technical steering, open source, product development, budget oversight, and growth and marketing.&#x20;

If changes are required, the [governing board](intersects-structure/intersect-governance.md) will review proposed changes and support the membership.

Working groups typically roll up into one of the eight committees. Working groups are, for the most part, temporary functions that support a committees' wider objectives or to expand expertise by seeking contributions from outside of Intersect. Working groups can be on any subject and are by nature less formal than standing committees.
