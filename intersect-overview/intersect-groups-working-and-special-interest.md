# Intersect groups (working & special interest)

## Working Groups

Working Groups are aligned to an [Intersect Committee](https://intersect.gitbook.io/committee-overview) and their purpose. &#x20;

Working Groups are:

* Aligned to and overseen by a Committee,
* Informal and open in nature
* Short-term&#x20;
* Focused around a defined purpose&#x20;
* Have an agreed output. &#x20;

Any Member can request to be part of a Working Group, you can contact them through their discord channel.

If you have a proposal for a working group we recommend engaging with the [committee ](https://intersect.gitbook.io/committee-overview)you feel this aligns with in the first instance, if you are unsure you can start by forming a Special Interest Group and attending Committee meetings.

Please don't hesitate in contacting the a [committee ](https://intersect.gitbook.io/committee-overview)or the [Committee Liaison](mailto:karen.wickham@intersectmbo.org) if you have any questions. &#x20;



## Special Interest Groups

Intersect Special Interest Groups are a newer concept within Intersect. &#x20;

Special Interest Groups are:

* Groups of members who are all interested in a specific subject. &#x20;
* Informal and open in nature&#x20;
* Formed around the subject of interest and&#x20;
* Not time bound. &#x20;
* Able to convert to being a Working Group if appropriate.
* Aligned to a committee / function if their subject aligns to a committee purpose&#x20;

Anyone can request to be part of a Special Interest Group, you can contact them through their discord channel.   &#x20;

A link to form a Special Interest Group will be posted here. (When Available)



## **Technical / Product Working Groups**

Technical Working Groups which are aligned to Cardano Infrastructure development, they were previously also known as Product Working Groups. &#x20;

Technical  Working Groups are:

* Defined by the scope of the development they have been commissioned to deliver
* Different in time length as this will depend on their development delivery and these timescales confirmed with Delivery Assurance Technical Steering Committee or Open Source Committee.&#x20;
* Have agreed and formalised milestones / key deliveries
* More formal in nature as they have been "commissioned" to deliver a technical development.&#x20;
