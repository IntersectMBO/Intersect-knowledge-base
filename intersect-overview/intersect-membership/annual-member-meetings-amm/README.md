# Annual Member Meetings (AMM)

## What is an annual member meeting?

An annual member meeting is a formal gathering held annually by an organization, such as a nonprofit, where its members come together to discuss and vote on important issues. These meetings typically serve several purposes:

1. **Review of the Past Year**
2. **Election of Board Members**
3. **Voting on Important Matters (such as committee elections)**
4. **Member Input and Questions**
5. **Future Planning**

Annual member meetings are important for maintaining transparency, accountability, and member engagement within the organization.

## Why does Intersect run an annual member meeting?

Intersect is a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem, putting members at the heart of Cardanoâ€™s future development. Intersect is incorporated as a mutual-benefit not-for-profit organization in Wyoming. Our state obligations require that we hold an annual meeting for members.

## Why should you join?

The annual member meeting is an opportunity for members to connect, review the work done over the year, and discuss important topics.
