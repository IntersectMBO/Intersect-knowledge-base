# Intersect Steering committee

## What is the Intersect Steering Committee?

The Intersect Steering Committee brings together member elected representatives, elected committee chairs, and Functional Directors of Intersect.

ISC is a collective member driven governing body which will oversee all standing committees and functions within Intersect. It will enable effective collective decision making and communication flows between the Intersect Board, committees, community representatives and Functional Directors.

In turn this will drive forward the growth of Intersect on behalf of the Intersect membership and wider Cardano ecosystem.
