Intersect is a member-based organisation (MBO), which means the community is in charge of steering and organising the future of Cardano’s blockchain. Anyone or any organisation in the community can choose to join Intersect.

The committees are teams made up of people from the Cardano community. They steer and provide recommendations on behalf of the community at large.&#x20;

Since Intersect was established in January 2024 the committees have been staffed from initial volunteers, Intersect administration and Seed Funding organisation resources.  They have brought us such a long way and have got us to a stable position.  Thanks to them we are now at a phase of maturity where we can take the next step and ask the membership community to apply for these seats and elect their committee members to allow us to continue striving forward. &#x20;

## Upcoming elections - September & October 2024

To ensure we don’t lose any momentum we are going to take a phased approach and elect part of the committee seats as part of the AMM and then hold a second election in April to vote in the remaining committee seats
