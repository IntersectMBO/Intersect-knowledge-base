{% hint style="warning" %}
The Parameter Committee is a key group in the Cardano ecosystem, acting as a subcommittee of the Technical Steering Committee.&#x20;

Its members are chosen for their technical expertise and vetted against specific criteria. While not elected formally, the committee is accountable to the elected steering committees and the broader Intersect membership. It aims to promote fair and transparent democratic processes, providing opportunities for participation whenever possible.&#x20;

As Cardano grows or evolves, the structure of subcommittees and working groups may be reviewed at the request of the membership.
