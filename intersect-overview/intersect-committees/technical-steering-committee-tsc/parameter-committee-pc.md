## What is the Parameter Committee?

The Parameter Committee is a subcommittee of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) that ensures the Cardano protocol parameters are set based on sound technical awareness and best practices. This subcommittee includes four working groups:

* Economic Parameters Advisory Group
* Network Parameters Advisory Group
* Technical Parameters Advisory Group
* Governance Parameters Advisory Group

## Why is this committee important?

The purpose of this committee is to provide technical advice and recommendations relating to updating protocol parameters, taking into account economic, security, network, and other technical considerations as appropriate to protect the long-term sustainability of the Cardano blockchain.

## Which topics does this committee cover?

The committee meets every three weeks to discuss all Cardano protocol parameters, including network, technical, and economic parameters, providing technical advice and recommendations based on updated parameter settings. They also consider community proposals to update parameters.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Parameters Committee is a mature and highly effective group that plays a crucial role in the Cardano ecosystem. It is a subcommittee of the Technical Steering Committee. At this time, subcommittees and working groups are not subject to formal elections. However, they are to be held accountable by their elected steering committees and ultimately the Intersect membership. Wherever practically possible, they should provide opportunities for all to participate, and to align with what we hope are seen as fair and transparent democratic processes used by Intersect steering committees. As Intersect grows or should the capacity and purpose of subcommittees and working groups change, at the request of the membership, this decision may be reviewed in the future. The members of the Parameters Committee are vetted individuals who meet specific criteria and possess the necessary technical expertise for effective decision-making. This structure ensures that the committee operates efficiently and makes informed decisions for the Cardano ecosystem.
