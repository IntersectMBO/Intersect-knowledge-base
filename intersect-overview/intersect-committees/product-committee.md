# Product committee

## What is the Product committee?

We originally designed a Vision committee for [Intersect](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) as our 7th committee with the remit to manage visionary scope and roadmap for future development items.&#x20;

We now see that we need a committee to manage a variety of different types of Cardano development scope and establish a roadmap. In this way, Vision could then become a category of the scope where other categories of scope can be Continuity (maintenance, upgrades, and core development), features, or research. The scope may also include categories such as marketing, promotion, or other non-technical categories.

Vision, strategy, and roadmap are all elements of a product function, because of this in its first meeting the committee updated its name from Roadmap Committee (originally Vision Committee) to Product Committee.

## Why is this committee important?

The Product committee facilitates the processes that help the Cardano community to create a vision and a strategy.

## Which topics does this committee cover?

The Product committee will cover topics such as roadmap, focusing on the 'why' and the related strategy, long-term vision and broader user/customer needs.

## How to join?

Any member of Intersect can run for election to become a voting seat, and any member or associate of Intersect can connect to the Product committee via the Intersect discord server.
