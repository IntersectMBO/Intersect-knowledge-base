The Constitutional Committee Portal (CC Portal) is part of the core governance tools, supporting the key steps of the Cardano governance process.

The CC Portal is a community tool that have been developed via an Intersect grant.

The CC Portal, together with the other core tools such as the Voltaire Govtool, is currently managed by the Intersect [Governance tools WG](https://intersect.gitbook.io/intersect-committees-groups/groups-overview/working-groups/governance-tools-working-group), and it is developed and maintained by the Bloxico team.

## Key features

The CC Portal provides access to a user-friendly version of the Cardano Constitution (as of now the Interim one), provides the Constitutional Committee members an easy interface to create the metadata to attach as rationale to the votes they submit on-chain, and provides context about Constitutional Committee members votes to Cardano community.
