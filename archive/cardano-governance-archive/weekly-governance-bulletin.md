As the landscape of Cardano Governance is constantly changing, with new governance actions being raised and voted upon, we felt it essential to cut through the noise and report on the latest governance actions. Moving forward, we will offer a concise and informative overview of key developments in the governance process in this new weekly bulletin. It is designed to keep everyone informed, from ada holders to DReps, ICCs, and SPOs. Each week, you will get updates on:

## Hard Fork Working Group Updates

### Node 10.1 Pre-Release and Testing

Node 10.1, the latest update, has successfully passed internal testing and is set for community preview. This release includes essential fixes and has been stress-tested to confirm stability, so we’re confident it’s ready for a full mainnet launch, potentially this week.

### Governance Actions and Hard Fork Prep

For the hard fork, we need two key governance actions:

**Plutus Cost Model Update** – Necessary adjustments to prepare the network.

**Hard Fork Metadata** – A detailed description of the upgrade’s goals and impact, ensuring transparency. This draft has been shared internally for review and will be finalized soon.

We’re aiming to submit this proposal to the mainnet by early November, with a goal of having at least 85% of stake pools upgraded to support a smooth transition.

## Stake Pool and DRep Engagement

Boosting participation from delegated representatives (DReps) is a priority, as it strengthens community representation in Cardano’s governance. Our goal is to double current participation to match levels seen in Catalyst, and we’re rolling out communications to help make this happen. This includes regular blog updates, social media posts, and Twitter spaces for direct engagement.

## Security and Participation Goals

Discussions have been held around minimum participation thresholds to ensure the upgrade’s security, and we’re working to establish a safe baseline for DRep involvement. Although no exact percentage is required, we aim to have strong representation to support smooth decision-making.

## Upcoming Events and Resources

Once the mainnet launch date is confirmed, we’ll host a Q\&A to address community questions. Our knowledge base is also regularly updated with resources, meeting summaries, and recorded sessions to keep everyone informed.
