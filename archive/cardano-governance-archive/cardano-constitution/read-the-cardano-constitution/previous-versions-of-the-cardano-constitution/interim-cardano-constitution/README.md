# Interim Constitution

This interim constitution provides the basic rules needed to implement CIP-1694. It's temporary and will be replaced by a final constitution, which Ada holders will ratify in late 2024 or early 2025. The final version may be quite different, depending on what the Cardano community wants.

With these guardrails in place, the interim Constitutional Committee will focus on the technicality and base constitutionality of the very first community-submitted on-chain governance actions, upholding the interim constitution.
