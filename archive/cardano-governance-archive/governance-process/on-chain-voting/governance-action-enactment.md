# Governance action enactment

A Governance Action gets implemented (or enacted) after it has been [ratified](../../key-terms/ratification.md) through on-chain voting. Ratified actions are then **enacted** on-chain, following a set of well-defined rules.

Note: Enactment for [Info actions](../../key-terms/governance-action/ga-info.md) is a null action, since they do not have any effect on the protocol.
