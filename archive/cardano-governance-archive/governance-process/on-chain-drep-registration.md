# On-chain DRep registration

On-Chain [DRep](broken-reference) registration is the process that allows ADA holders to register themselves as Delegated Representatives, giving them the ability to represent themselves or others when voting on active On-Chain Governance Actions.

This step also allows ADA Holders that register as DReps to add optional [Metadata](../key-terms/metadata.md) to the registration. The suggested use for this is to add extra context useful for other ADA holders to make a decision about delegation.

{% hint style="info" %}
On-Chain DRep registration can be  performed through the Cardano CLI and through the Voltaire GovTool.
