# Off-chain governance action outcome socialisation

Governance Action outcomes should be socialised in an Off-Chain process after they get ratified or expire.

This should be true for all Governance Actions, regardless of their outcome, and even more for those important Governance Actions that get ratified and will be enacted.

## Why it is important?

The Governance process is a linear one, which start with Off-Chain community discussion and should end with the outcome. It is so important to close that loop by sharing the outcome of the On-Chain vote Off-Chain, preferably where the process started (so where the original Off-Chain Proposal was submitted)

## Governance Actions Outcome

To support this critical step of the Governance Process Intersect will issue a grant to build a new part of Govtool. More information about this grant will be shared when the grant opens.
