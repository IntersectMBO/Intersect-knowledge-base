# CIP-95

[CIP-95](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0095/README.md) is a proposal designed to empower ada holders with a voice by way of voting capabilities, using a standards-based approach to maximize wallet implementations and therefore enfranchisement. During a tooling hackathon event in Edinburgh, participants achieved a general consensus around prior Open Question decisions, ratifying the proposalâ€™s base design.
