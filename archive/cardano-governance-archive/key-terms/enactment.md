# Enactment

Enactment refers to a [Governance Action](governance-action/). A Governance Action gets implemented (or enacted) after it has been [ratified](ratification.md) through On-Chain Voting. Ratified actions are then **enacted** on-chain, following a set of well-defined rules.

Note: Enactment for [Info actions](governance-action/ga-info.md) is a null action, since they do not have any effect on the protocol.
