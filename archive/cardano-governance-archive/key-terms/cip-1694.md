[CIP-1694](https://www.1694.io) introduces a new on-chain governance model for Cardano. This CIP seeks to advance the current governance system, ensuring every ada holder has a voice in Cardano’s governance.

The proposal outlines a tricameral model consisting of stake pool operators (SPOs), Delegated Representatives (DReps), and a Constitutional Committee (CC), each with distinct responsibilities and roles.

The CIP-1694 proposal was merged into the main branch of the CIP GitHub repository on June 30, 2023, marking its transition to the “Proposed” status.
