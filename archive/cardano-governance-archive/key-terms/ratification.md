# Ratification

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/this-page-has-been-archived.md" %}

Ratification refers to a [Governance Action](governance-action/). A Governance Action gets approved (or ratified) if it reaches the defined [thresholds](threshold.md).

Governance actions are ratified through on-chain voting actions. While different kinds of governance actions have different requirements, ratification always involves two of the three governance bodies (DReps, Constitutional Committee and SPOs), with the exception of a hard-fork initiation, which requires ratification by all governance bodies.

Depending on the type of governance action, an action will be ratified when a combination of the following occurs:

* the Constitutional Committee (CC) approves of the action (the number of 'Yes' votes meets the CC’s threshold)
* the DReps approve of the action (the stake controlled by the DReps who vote 'Yes' meets a certain threshold of the total active voting stake)
* the SPOs approve of the action (the stake controlled by the SPOs who vote 'Yes' meets a certain threshold over the total registered voting stake)

\
The ratification period is the time that elapses between a governance action being submitted and its ratification.
