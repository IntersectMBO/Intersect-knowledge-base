# Chang upgrade

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/this-page-has-been-archived.md" %}

The Chang upgrade, to be enabled by a hard fork combinator event in 2024, will apply the technical capabilities of CIP-1694’s on-chain governance onto mainnet. The upgrade is named in honor of Phil Chang, who sadly passed away in 2022. Phil was an early leader in Cardano governance at IOG, and his thinking contributed significantly to the early design of Voltaire. He understood that governance brings out the best and worst of the human condition, and always approached his work with the reverence and mindfulness that it demanded and deserved.
