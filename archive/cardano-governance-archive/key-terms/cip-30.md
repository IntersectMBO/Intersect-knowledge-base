# CIP-30

[CIP-30](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030) describes a web-based communication bridge allowing web pages and DApps to interface with Cardano wallets through injected JavaScript code.

This CIP defines how web pages and DApps access the injected code, and also defines the API for DApps to communicate with the user's wallet.
