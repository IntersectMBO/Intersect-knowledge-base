# Functional requirements

* Proposed solutions should reduce one or more barriers to entry for specific groups of people in the Cardano community, such as a language barrier, localisation or technology access.  &#x20;
* The proposal should attempt to quantify how many people/how much stake in the ecosystem is affected by this barrier to entry.
* The proposal should provide a solution to eliminate or vastly reduce the barrier to entry.
* Proposals that include an educational aspect will be considered as an added bonus as we were not able to include all desirable proposals in the educational and multimedia grant category.
