Please note: This grant is currently closed for the remainder of 2024 and will reopen in 2025.

Intersect's main aim is to facilitate the administration of decentralized governance on Cardano. As such, we would like to see community hubs across the globe being set up to support the CIP1694 Governance Technology. Ensuring that local ideas and issues can be represented and considered for governance actions is essential so that Governance on Cardano is spread and benefits all, further enhancing the decentralization of governance on Cardano.

Intersect is looking for passionate and organized members of the Cardano community to step up and establish community hubs within their geographic location to help build, develop, educate, and enable the local community to contribute toward governance actions on Cardano.
