# Considerations

{% include "../../../../../../../.gitbook/includes/this-page-has-been-archived.md" %}

Consider the below before submitting your application:

* Suggested Milestone:
  * Wireframe and user testing
  * Hifi mockup using govtool design system and user testing
  * MVP development, preferably in time for Change Hard Fork #2 (depending on the applicant proposal, the size of MVP will be defined with the Governance tools working group)
  * Readiness for mainnet
* The successful applicant will need to test their implementation on sanchonet, preview, preprod, before mainnet.
* Any company that maintains one of our core repositories will not be able to apply but may be called upon to support the evaluation.
