With the minimum viable on-chain governance introduced by [CIP-1694,](https://www.1694.io/) ada holders will be enabled to fully participate in Cardanoâ€™s on-chain decision-making, including having the ability to submit Governance Actions (GA), register as a DRep, or delegate to one. As we advance both on- and off-chain governance in the age of Voltaire, there need to be openly available online resources for ada holders and the ecosystem to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and components of Cardano governance.

Intersect offers grants for members to develop multimedia educational resources to help educate, onboard, and engage ada holders to participate in the new governance features made available with CIP-1694.
