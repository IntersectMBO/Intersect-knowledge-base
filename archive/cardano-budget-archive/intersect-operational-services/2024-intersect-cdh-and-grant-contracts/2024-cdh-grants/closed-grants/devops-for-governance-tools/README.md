## Overview

The Intersect team has facilitated the creation of the foundational tools that will support Cardano governance.\
\
Over the past 6 months, Intersect members (such as Byron Network, DQuadrant, WeDeliver, and Bloxico) have worked developing these tools (current implementation can be tested on [sanchogov.tools](https://sanchogov.tools/dashboard)).

\
In the ongoing effort to distribute and decentralize the ownership and maintenance of these tools, we tasked a member of the community to define a DevOps strategy.

Based on that we now have clear requirements to award a contract to a member of the community to support the DevOps work for these Governance Tools.

## Grant

Intersect is providing a grant of up to ADA 90,000 to support the work described in the Requirements section until the end of 2024 (≈ 7 months).

Application submission will open on the 12th of April and close on the 25th of April. The winner will be awarded by the 3rd of May.
