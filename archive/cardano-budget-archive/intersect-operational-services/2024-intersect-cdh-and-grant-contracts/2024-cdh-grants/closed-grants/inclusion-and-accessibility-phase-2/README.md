# Inclusion and Accessibility phase 2

{% include "../../../../../../../.gitbook/includes/this-page-has-been-archived.md" %}

## Overview

Govtool and the Constitutional Committee Portal are part of the foundational community tools that will support Cardano governance. To make these tools more accessible, Intersect is providing a grant to implement a tool that allows Cardano community to participate in doing the translations and grants to do the actual translations into the key selected languages.

## Sub-Categories

There will be 3 subcategories of grants provided:

1. A Grant to implement the translation tool
2. Grants to translate GovTool and the Constitutional Committee Portal. _Please note, the first grant needs to be delivered for this to be actioned._
3. Grants to translate the Interim Constitution. _Please note, this will be offered to Constitutional workshop hosts and participants to take the lead with their local language, including self-assessment that the translation has been done correctly._
