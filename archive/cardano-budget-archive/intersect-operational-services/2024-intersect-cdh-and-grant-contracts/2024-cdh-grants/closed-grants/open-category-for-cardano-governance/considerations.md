# Considerations

### Collaboration

The journey to participate in Cardano Governance will be better as a connected experience. Proposers are encouraged to collaborate with other members where helpful, especially for integration.

### Expected cost range

There is no set amount for the Open Category, as it’d be preferable for applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution, allowing for a broader range of creativity. However, to help applicants sense-check their proposal, the maximum amount is 200,000 ADA for the Open category. Multiple proposals are likely to be selected for these categories so smaller proposals are more likely to be accepted unless there is valid reasoning for the larger sums requested.

### Suggested minimum milestones

The milestones below are indicative and proposals should ideally not exceed a six month delivery plan. Proposals should also broadly align with the [CIP-1694 roadmap](https://www.intersectmbo.org/roadmap).

| Milestone                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Design phase or outline if non-code                                                  |
| Testable prototype or first draft if non-code                                        |
| MVP - meets minimum requirements, fully working version or first version if non-code |
| V1.0 - implement new features and/or improvements                                    |
