# 2024 Cardano Continuity contracts

In 2024, several contracts were contracted for the purpose of Cardano “Continuity”. Cardano Continuity is defined or referred to in the contracts as any approved technical services needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain. Continuity in this definition can include new development, such as the CIP-1694 governance software, upgrades to components or improvements in testing.&#x20;

In 2024, delivery assurance was pivotal in the core continuity remit, managing 14 contracts. Most of which have successfully completed. The complete list of [suppliers](cardano-continuity-suppliers/) and the relevant projects is publicly available [here](cardano-continuity-suppliers/cardano-continuity-reports/).

As we begin 2025, the role of delivery assurance in Intersect has evolved significantly. Initially established to manage contracts with the remit of 'core continuity' technical work, this function has grown alongside the organization, adapting to serve our membership needs better.

Initially, delivery assurance focused on overseeing technical contracts, ensuring projects were managed efficiently and effectively on behalf of the ecosystem. Over time, however, the team's responsibilities have expanded to provide broader support across various contract types.&#x20;
