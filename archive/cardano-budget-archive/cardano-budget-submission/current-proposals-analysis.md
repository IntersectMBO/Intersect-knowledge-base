### Proposals that self-reference a committee’s priority

As of April 22, 2025

In February 2025, seven Intersect committees each published their Draft Bucket Proposals (first release). These budgets outlined the line items they deemed to be important for the Cardano ecosystem in their domain. To find more information about the proposed budget, see the conversation [here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/overview-a-cardano-blockchain-ecosystem-budget/143049).

\
Based on the proposals submitted to receive treasury funding, these self-reported alignment to a committee’s priority and may indicate alignment to the committee members’ opinions of what is critical for the ecosystem:

#### Proposals that self-report alignment to product roadmap

As of April 22, 2025\\

In March 2025, a vision and [product roadmap for Cardano was submitted as an info-action on-chain](https://gov.tools/outcomes/governance_actions/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc636#0) and received 63% DRep support. Developed by Cardano Product Committee of Intersect with consultation from key technical stakeholders, the roadmap outlines key development priorities, technological advancements, and strategic goals for the Cardano ecosystem. Proposers were asked to report if their proposal is aligned to any of these roadmap items.
