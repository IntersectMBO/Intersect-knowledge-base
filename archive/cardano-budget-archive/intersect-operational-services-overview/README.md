{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/this-page-has-been-archived.md" %}

**Introduction**

The purpose of Intersect’s Operational Services is to support any individual or organization within the Cardano ecosystem that wishes to submit a proposal related to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem for inclusion in a Cardano Budget. If the proposer is successful in securing funding and Intersect has been named as the administrator, then Operational services will include the following:

* Contract management
* Delivery assurance and Communications
* Fund management
* Fiat conversion
* Legal
* KYC / KYB
* Dispute resolution
* Technical and Financial auditing

Our approach ensures compliance, transparency, and effective management of resources, enabling selected vendors to focus on their objectives.
