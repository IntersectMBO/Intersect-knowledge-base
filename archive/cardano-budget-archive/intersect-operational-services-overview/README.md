**Introduction**

The purpose of Intersectâ€™s Operational Services is to support any individual or organization within the Cardano ecosystem that wishes to submit a proposal related to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem for inclusion in a Cardano Budget. If the proposer is successful in securing funding and Intersect has been named as the administrator, then Operational services will include the following:&#x20;

* Contract management&#x20;
* Delivery assurance and Communications&#x20;
* Fund management&#x20;
* Fiat conversion&#x20;
* Legal
* KYC / KYB
* Dispute resolution&#x20;
* Technical and Financial auditing

Our approach ensures compliance, transparency, and effective management of resources, enabling selected vendors to focus on their objectives.
