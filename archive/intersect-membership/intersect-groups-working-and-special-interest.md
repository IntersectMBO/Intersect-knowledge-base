## Working Groups

Working Groups are aligned to an [Intersect Committee](https://intersect.gitbook.io/committee-overview) and their purpose.

Working Groups are:

* Aligned to and overseen by a Committee,
* Informal and open
* Short-term
* Focused around a defined purpose
* Have an agreed output.

Any Member can request to be part of a Working Group, you can contact them through their discord channel.

If you have a proposal for a working group we recommend engaging with the [committee ](https://intersect.gitbook.io/committee-overview)you feel this aligns with in the first instance, if you are unsure you can start by forming a Special Interest Group and attending Committee meetings.

Please don't hesitate to contact the [committee ](https://intersect.gitbook.io/committee-overview)or the [Committee Liaison](mailto:karen.wickham@intersectmbo.org) if you have any questions.

## Special Interest Groups

Intersect Special Interest Groups are a newer concept within Intersect.

Special Interest Groups are:

* Groups of members who are all interested in a specific subject.
* Informal and open
* Formed around the subject of interest and
* Not time-bound.
* Able to convert to being a Working Group if appropriate.
* Aligned to a committee / function if their subject aligns with a committee purpose

Anyone can request to be part of a Special Interest Group, you can contact them through their discord channel.

A link to form a Special Interest Group can be found [here](https://mpc.intersectmbo.org/sig-sign-up).

## **Technical / Product Working Groups**

Technical Working Groups which are aligned to Cardano Infrastructure development, they were previously also known as Product Working Groups.

Technical Working Groups are:

* Defined by the scope of the development they have been commissioned to deliver
* Different in time length as this will depend on their development delivery and these timescales are confirmed with the Delivery Assurance Technical Steering Committee or Open Source Committee.
* Have agreed and formalized milestones / key deliveries
* More formal in nature as they have been "commissioned" to deliver a technical development.

More information and a list of Working Groups can be found in the [Intersect - Committees & Groups](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/CRHkYsBzWMnZsSk4kyFU/ "mention") space
