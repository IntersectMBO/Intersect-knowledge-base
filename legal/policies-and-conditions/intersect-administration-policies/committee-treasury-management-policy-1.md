**5. Policy Owner:**  Head of Procurement

**6. Policy Sponsor:** Operations Director

***

**7. Purpose**:

This Policy is written to ensure all Committee funds, whether allocated directly through the Committee Treasury funds or via the Intersect Treasury funds, are managed and accounted for. It ensures all funds are used appropriately over the course of a Treasury budget cycle.



**8. Scope:**

The Committee approved initiatives and associated funds are to be executed under the direction and recommendations of the respective Committee. The Intersect Executive Director, also the administrator of the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), holds ultimate accountability for all associated budgets and contracts. The following conditions and processes are in place to ensure proper execution and accountability. Given the legal and financial structure of Intersect, the committee funds are to be approved and executed by Intersect. Our intention is to honor and deliver the spirit of what DReps have approved with full commitment and collaboration with the Committees.



**9. Principles:**

* Scope of Authority: The Intersect Executive Director (Intersect Board and Executive  Directors) retains ultimate accountability for all Committee budgets and all contracted or paid-out expenses. This includes:
  * All Committee budget contracts with the CDH.
  * All individual contracts with subcontractors and vendors.
  * Every single payment made as a result of these contracts.

To ensure proper governance, every contract and payment must be approved and signed by the Intersect Executive Director. Direction will only be sought from the voting members of the respective Committees, and wherever possible evidence of their vote is required.



**10. Definitions:**

* **Cardano Development Holdings (CDH):** CDH is a legal entity created to support the Cardano ecosystem by acting as the contracting counterparty for approved proposals by DReps.
* **Conflict of Interest:** A conflict of interest arises when an individual’s personal, professional, or financial interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with the interests of the Committee.
* **Intersect:** Intersect serves as an Administrator within Cardano’s funding ecosystem, helping to operationalize community-approved proposals by coordinating due diligence, contracting, and on-chain disbursements. This role is grounded in the principles of transparency, decentralization, and adherence to the Cardano Constitution.
* **Master Services Agreement (MSA):** A contract that sets the general terms and conditions for an ongoing business relationship, so future projects or services can be added easily without renegotiating the basic rules each time.
* **Milestone(s)** means the dates by which a part or all of the Services is to be completed, as set out in a Statement of Work.
* [**Milestone Acceptance Form (MAF):** ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1kC5q7LwHpQNGHdq9uXv5o5LNHXlDbxCJXtvMeenkA/edit?tab=t.0)This is a written attestation in the form of a standard template, submitted by a vendor, for each milestone.
* **Request For Proposal:** Document a company or organisation issues to invite vendors to submit detailed proposals for a specific project or service. It outlines the project requirements, goals, deadlines, and evaluation criteria so suppliers can propose how they would meet the needs and at what cost. Intersect will use this process to find and select a vendor for a project.
* **Statement of Work** means the document describing the Services and Deliverables to be provided by the Vendor, the Milestones, date of completion, expected quality standards, and associated fees.&#x20;
* **Repeat Business and Ongoing Relationships** refers to situations where a Committee engages with the same vendor, supplier, consultant, or grantee on multiple occasions or through consecutive contracts or awards.



**11. Policy Statements/Procedures:**

* **Master Treasury Withdrawal Contract Approval:** Committee secretaries, under the direction of voting members, will work with the Intersect Procurement team to finalise milestones in the Committee Master Treasury Withdrawal contract. Once these milestones are confirmed by the Committee Chair acting on behalf of voting members and Intersect Head of Procurement, the Intersect Executive Director, Committee Chair and Committee Secretary will sign the Master contract approval document.
* **Program-Specific Contracts:** For individual programs, the process is as follows:
  * **Monthly planning:** Committee Secretary aligns with Intersect Finance, Procurement team and Operations lead on upcoming programs in the month. This allows Procurement and Operational teams to align on planning and contract template readiness.
  *   **Vendor Approval**: In line with the programs of work stipulated in the Master Contract, the Committee can run the approval for a vendor in several ways:

      * **Running an RFP/Grant:** Follow the [Intersect RFP/Grant guidelines](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/2025-apply-for-tender) to solicit bids.
      * **Directly selecting a vendor:** This is only permitted if the vendor is the only one in the ecosystem with the necessary skills to fulfill the contract and justification must be provided to Intersect Procurement team

      In either case, the chosen vendor must be approved by a vote from the Committee members. If an RFP/Grant was used, the Intersect Operations lead will oversee the process. If a vendor is chosen without an RFP/Grant, the Committee must provide a justification which may be shared with the Community, explaining why this to be the case (e.g. the vendor being the only one with the necessary skills to do the job.)
  * **Information Handover:** Once the designated vendor has been agreed by the Committee following a fair, transparent selection process, the Committee secretary provides the vendor's name, contract details, budget and scope of work to the Intersect procurement team, via the Committee Procurement Request Form on Clickup. This needs to evidence formal sign off via the Committee by sharing evidence of when the decision was made.
  * **Procurement Request Process:** The Committee Secretary is required to submit all Committee procurement related requests through the relevant Procurement Request form on Click-Up, once agreed within the Committee. This applies to all requests, including but not limited to, Master Service Agreements (MSAs), statements of work, travel, software or any required contract/payment.
  * **Due Diligence:** The procurement team performs necessary checks (e.g., KYB/C) and confirms alignment with the overall budget. They will then become the point of contact with the vendor.
  * **Final Signature**: Once the procurement team and vendor agree on the Statement of Work (SoW) or relevant contract, the Intersect Executive Director will sign the contract on behalf of Intersect acting as the sole Administrator of the CDH. The Committee will be informed of the signing.
  * **Delivery Assurance:** The Committee Secretary and voting Committee members will support the ongoing delivery and management of the contract with the Delivery Assurance (DA) team. The Secretary will be responsible for reporting requirements as part of the larger milestone reporting, including completing the [Milestone Acceptance Forms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16mflKXUKRVi1oJMh3_PomCqBJHdSH17L/view) for the Master contract. The Chair will ultimately remain accountable.&#x20;
  * **Payment Execution:** The Finance team will be provided with the payment details and schedule to process vendor payments.
