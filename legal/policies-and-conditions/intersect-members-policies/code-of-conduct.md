# Code of Conduct

Version: 1.1 Apache 2.0 license, derived from the Apache Foundation code of conduct.

## Welcome to the Intersect Community!

At Intersect, our goal is to cultivate a safe, friendly, and inclusive space that benefits all members and non-members alike. To ensure that our community remains a positive and enriching environment for everyone, we've put together this Code of Conduct that outlines our shared values and expectations.

### When and How to Use These Guidelines

This code of conduct is your guide for engaging as a member or non-member of Intersect. It applies to all physical and digital spaces that Intersect hosts, manages, sponsors, or otherwise controls. Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all Intersect activities.

Share and Learn: Our community is a space for sharing knowledge, experiences, and ideas. Positively contribute to discussions, offer helpful feedback, be willing to educate others on your work, and remain open to learning from others, both members and non-members.

Give Credit: When sharing content or ideas that aren't your own, ensure you give proper credit to the original creator. Plagiarism and intellectual property infringement are strictly prohibited..

Respect Privacy: Always seek consent before sharing personal information about yourself or others. Respecting each other's privacy is vital to building trust within our community.

Be Inquisitive And Embrace Continuous Improvement: We strive to improve from each experience and are open to constructive criticism. We encourage questions and redirect them to the appropriate channel if we do not have the answer.

Stay On Topic: While we encourage friendly conversations, please ensure your discussions remain relevant to the community's purpose. To keep our space focused and valuable, off-topic or irrelevant content may be redirected or removed. Specific topics that are not appropriate include offering to buy or sell any cryptocurrency or engaging in price speculation.

No Hate Speech or Harassment: Let's maintain a constructive and uplifting atmosphere in all interactions. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of hate speech, bullying, harassment, or discrimination. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Sharing private content without explicit consent, such as messages sent privately or non-publicly.
* Personal insults.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior.

Have Fun and Connect: Finally, remember that Intersect is a place to connect, collaborate, learn, and work together to further the ongoing development of the Cardano ecosystem. But remember, to have fun!
