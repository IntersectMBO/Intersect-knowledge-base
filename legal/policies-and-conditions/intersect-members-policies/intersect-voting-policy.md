# Intersect Voting Policy

Intersect is a member led organization, as such member are required regularly to participate in votes and elections.

## Voting event types

Currently there are two types of vote:

* Elections: This types of votes allow members to propose the voting options or more generally to apply as candidates.
* Polls: This types of votes provide to members 2 or more options to select from.

Common Voting events currently include:

* Committee elections: The voting event where Intersect members elect one or more committees.
* Board elections: The voting event where Intersect members elect one or more board members.
* Chair elections: The voting event where Intersect members part of an existing Committee or the Board elect their respective chair.
* General polls: The voting event where members are asked to provide their opinion on any general matter.

## Existing voting rules

* Only paid members are allowed to join Intersect voting events
* For committee elections
  * Only paid members are allowed to apply
  * Only those who have been paid members for at least 3 months OR that have followed the process to verify themselves are allowed to vote
* For board elections
  * Only paid members are allowed to apply
  * Only those who have been paid members for at least 6 months OR that have followed the process to verify themselves are allowed to vote

## Election voting results - elected members terms

During the 2025 election, 4 members will be elected to the board. The two top-voted candidates will get a 2-year term, the next 2 will get a 1-year term (assuming they remain in good standing membership).

The above is done to start a process that staggers elections, keeping continuity in the board. From 2026 we will elect 2 seats with a 2 year term, starting a cycle to elect every year 2 board seats.
