# Committee Service Reward Policy

_Approved on 15th/09/25 by ISC_

Intersect Committee Service Rewards Policy

To encourage more people to apply to committees and increase regular time commitment to committee tasks (already quite high with current volunteering members) we would like to introduce monthly rewards. The assumption is that rewards will increase further the number of active contributors and incentivize existing ones. Furthermore, this will open committees to people in more geographies who perhaps can’t volunteer easily.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes the framework for Committee Service Reward paid to elected members of Intersect committees. The reward is intended as a token of appreciation to recognize the volunteer time, effort, and expertise contributed by members in fulfilling their elected committee member duties.

This policy applies to all elected members of Intersect committees. It does not apply to appointed advisors, Intersect professional staff, or members of the Intersect Executive Board.

## 2. Oversight and Responsibility

* The Intersect Steering Committee (ISC) is responsible for managing service reward discussions, proposing budget adjustments, and reviewing this policy.
* Service reward levels are subject to annual review and adjustment by ISC, aligned with the approved Intersect budget.
* The Intersect Board has oversight and approval over rewards levels, and policy adjustment, ensuring alignment with the approved Intersect budget.

## 3. Eligibility

* All elected Active Committee Members and Committee Chairs are eligible to receive service reward under this policy.&#x20;
* An “Active Committee Member” is one who has been elected and has not been dismissed for lack of participation.
* A “Committee Chair” is an elected committee member who has been selected to serve in a leadership role within their committee, with additional responsibilities including, but not limited to, leading committee meetings, coordinating committee activities and deliverables, serving as the primary representative of their committee at Intersect Steering Committee (ISC) meetings, and acting as the main point of contact between their committee and other Intersect governance bodies.
* Committee Chairs receive a higher service reward to reflect additional responsibilities.&#x20;
* **Limitations on remuneration**:
  * An individual may receive service reward for a maximum of two committee seats (as one member can only be elected to maximum of 2 committees at a time).
* **Reward Collection Process**:
  * Active Committee Members (based on definition above) are eligible to collect 50% of their reward (250 ADA for Active Committee Members and 500 ADA for Committee Chairs) every month. To collect the remaining 50% they will submit a short summary (500 characters max) of their contributions to the committee in that month. This summary will be made visible in the Intersect member area to other members.
* **ISC-specific eligibility**:
  * Only the four elected ISC members will receive service rewards for their ISC role.
  * Committee Chairs do not receive an additional reward for ISC participation, as representing their committee at ISC is part of their Chair responsibilities.
* **Exclusions**:
  * Intersect professional staff and Intersect Executive Board members are not eligible to receive service rewards, as they are already compensated through other means.
* **Non-Participation**:
  * Active Committee Members must attend scheduled meetings, in line with the [Committee Member Dismissal Policy](committee-member-resignation-and-dismissal-policy.md); elected members who fail to participate regularly in committee activities may be dismissed from their position. If that happens, they will not be considered an “Active Committee Member”’ and will not be eligible to receive service rewards.
  * Active Committee Members undergoing the offboarding process (4-weeks+ without participation) under the Dismissal Policy are not eligible to receive rewards.
* **Member Choice**:
  * Each eligible Active Committee Member retains the right to accept or decline their service rewards.
  * Active Committee Members who choose not to receive service rewards do not need to provide justification for their decision.

## 4. Committee Service Rewards Rates (June 2025 – June 2026)

* Active Committee Members: 500 ADA per month
* Committee Chairs: 1,000 ADA per month (500 ADA for contribution as an Active Committee Member + an extra 500 ADA for extra contribution in chair role)
* Service rewards rates are fixed for the current budget cycle and may be reviewed annually.

## 5. Implementation and Review

* Service rewards will commence from June 2025 and remain in place until June 2026, in alignment with the Intersect budget cycle approved by the DReps.
* Payments will not be backdated beyond the initially approved date.
* Service rewards levels will be reviewed annually by ISC as part of the Intersect budget process.
* Adjustments may be proposed based on available treasury resources, inflation, or evolving governance needs.

## 6. Payment Terms

Members will be able to collect stipends autonomously. Payment processes and terms will be described in a separate document.

The Intersect team will determine the platform and procedures, ensuring security, auditability, and compliance with budget approvals.

## 7. Compliance and Accountability

* Recipients are expected to actively contribute to committee work, including regular attendance at meetings and participation in deliverables.
* Consistent with the [Committee Member Dismissal Policy](committee-member-resignation-and-dismissal-policy.md), members who do not fulfill their duties will forfeit eligibility for service rewards.
* Any member willing to receive the service rewards accepts to be subject to a standard KYC process.&#x20;
* Prior to receiving any service reward, all recipients will be required to provide either an IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable, for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes.&#x20;

## 8. Effective Date

This policy takes effect from the date of its approval by ISC, and payments will be backdated to June 2025 and will remain valid through June 2026, subject to annual review by ISC.
