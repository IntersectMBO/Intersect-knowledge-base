| CIP Format: Backwards compatibility         | All CIPs that introduce reverse incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CIP Format: Motivation                      | The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Cardano protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate in addressing the problem that the CIP solves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| CIP Format: Path to Active                  | A reference implementation, observable metrics, or anything showing the acceptance of the proposal in the community. It must be completed before any CIP is given the status "Active," but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale and reach a consensus before writing any code.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| CIP Format: Preamble                        | Headers containing metadata about the CIP ([see below](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip1/#cip-header-preamble)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| CIP Format: Rationale                       | The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during the discussion.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| CIP Format: Specification                   | The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the current Cardano platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| CIP Status: Active                          | The proposal is deemed to have met all the appropriate criteria for being considered active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Free Software                               | Free software is distributed free of charge, and users can modify and redistribute it without restrictions. Focused on access to the source code, the free software movement is as much a political organization as anything else. Under the free software licensing model, developers can even charge for software distribution. However, these broad rights are conditioned upon the users’ commitment to provide similar access to their code modifications and to never narrow the licensing rights as a condition of distribution. |

| Technical Debt                              | Also called "code debt" or design debt," technical debt is extra work that builds up, usually when an easy, short-term programming solution is taken rather than a better, long-term solution, forcing the developer(s) to do more work later to fix it. Usually used in the context of refactoring. Taking the easy way out leads to technical debt, which must be "paid back" in the form of rework in the future.                                                                                                                    |
