# Member decision making process

## Intersect Governance Decision-Making Process

Intersect’s decision-making process provides a structured path for turning members and community ideas and proposals into actionable outcomes through working groups (WGs), Intersect committees, the internal team, and the Board. It ensures clarity, transparency, and appropriate escalation depending on the proposal’s impact level.

This workflow helps us balance:

* Members-driven input and proposals,
* Strategic alignment across governance bodies,
* Timely and effective operational execution.

It is the result of discussions within the Intersect **Governance Working Group and Intersect Steering Committee**, with the goal of streamlining how decisions are made while preserving escalation, review, and transparency mechanisms.
