DoubleClick uses cookies to serve ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads multiple times. Google uses a cookie ID to determine which ads are running in which browser and can prevent them from being displayed multiple times. In addition, DoubleClick uses cookie IDs to track conversions related to ad requests. For example, if a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later goes to the advertiser’s website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.&#x20;

If you are registered with a service provided by Google, Google may associate the visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find and store your IP address.

You can prevent participation in this tracking process in several ways: a) by adjusting your browser software accordingly, in particular, the suppression of third-party cookies will prevent you from receiving any third party advertisements; b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain “[www.googleadservices.com](http://www.googleadservices.com/)”, [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads), this setting is deleted when you delete your cookies; c) by deactivating the interest-based advertisements of the providers that are part of the “About Ads” self-regulation campaign via the link [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), this setting being deleted when you delete your cookies; d) by permanent deactivation in your browsers Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome under the link [http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin). We point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the features of this offer in full.&#x20;

### _**Web Fonts**_&#x20;

Company may use online web fonts to display texts and fonts on the Product.&#x20;

#### _**Google Web Fonts**_&#x20;

For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. For this purpose, your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.

### _**Newsletter**_&#x20;

You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.

The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.&#x20;

### _**Newsletter Tracking**_&#x20;

Newsletter tracking (also referred to as Web beacons or tracking pixels) is used if users have given their explicit prior consent. When the newsletter is dispatched, the external server can then record certain data related to the recipient, such as the time and date the newsletter is retrieved, the IP address or details regarding the email program (client) used. The name of the image file is personalized for every email recipient by a unique ID being appended to it. The sender of the email notes which ID belongs to which email address and is thus able to determine which newsletter recipient has just opened the email when the image is called. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter. This can be done by sending an email to this effect to [dataprotection@intersectmbo.org](mailto:dataprotection@intersectmbo.org). They can also remove themselves from the mailing list using the unsubscribe link in the newsletter.&#x20;
