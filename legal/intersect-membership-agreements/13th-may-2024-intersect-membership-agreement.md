Continued Membership after the Initial Term is subject to annual renewal.&#x20;

(b) The Company has the absolute right to discontinue and recall the Membership at any time in the event Member ceases to be in Good Standing.

If either Party so terminates, the Member shall not be entitled to receive any refund of the Member’s Membership Fee or any fees, dues or amounts paid in advance, and the Member shall remain obligated to pay the Company any outstanding obligations owed by Member to the Company at the time of termination. Effective as of the termination date, members will lose any rights and benefits of Membership.

Certain Members of the Company may be eligible to participate on (or designate members or Representatives to) the Board or committees, sub- or steering-committees and working groups of the Company (“Company Committees”).

(iii) Such Member will not have the ability to influence the designation of a Company Committee member or otherwise influence the direction of a Company Committee. Even as a Committee Member, there is no guarantee that such Member will be able to influence the decisions of the Board or any Company Committee, including with respect to the awarding of any grants or contracts.

### Section 5. Indemnification.&#x20;

Such Member is responsible and liable for all acts of such Member and such Member’s Representatives arising from, in connection with or otherwise relating or incident to the Membership.

\


(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Membership Documents, sets forth the entire understanding of the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and all prior understandings, whether written or oral, concerning the subject matter hereof are superseded by this Agreement.

(b) Amendments.  No amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement (or any provision hereof) will be effective unless specifically made in writing and duly signed by each Party. No waiver by the Company shall operate as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No course of dealing or failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

(c) Successors and Assigns. No Person that is not a Party will have any right or obligation pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by the Member (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the Company. Any assignment in violation of this Section 9(c) will be void, ab initio, and upon any such attempt, the Company may terminate Membership with no obligation to refund any fees paid up to and including the date of such termination.

(d) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict provision or rule (whether of such State or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to be applied.  Any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought solely in the  federal or state courts located in the State of Wyoming.  This Agreement may be filed with any court as written evidence of the knowing and voluntary irrevocable agreement among the Parties to waive any objections to jurisdiction, to venue or to convenience of forum. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MEMBERSHIP DOCUMENTS.

(e) Specific Performance. The Member acknowledges and agrees that (i) irreparable loss will occur in the event of a breach of this Agreement by such Member, money damages will be inadequate and the Company will have no adequate remedy at law and (ii) the Company shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies, to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or prevent violations hereof not only by an action for losses but also by an action for specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief.  If any such action is brought to enforce this Agreement, the Member hereby waives the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. Any injunction shall be available without the posting of any bond or other security.&#x20;

(f) Severability.&#x20;

(i) If, at the time of enforcement of this Agreement, a court of competent jurisdiction holds in a final, non-appealable judgment that the restrictions stated herein are illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration, scope or geographical area of the restriction or to substitute a duration or scope that is legal, valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable restriction for the stated period or scope.

(ii) If any provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever after giving effect to Section 9(h)(i) above, such provision will be fully severable, and this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision were not a part of this Agreement with the remaining provisions of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect and unaffected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.&#x20;

(g) Joint Negotiation.  The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.  In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

(h) Cumulative Remedies. All rights and remedies of any Party are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such Party may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more such rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.

(i) Construction. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa.  The words “include” and “including,” and other words of similar import when used herein shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation but rather shall be deemed to be followed in each case by the words “without limitation.”  Any reference herein to “dollars” or “$” shall mean United States dollars.  The term “or” shall be deemed to mean the conjunctive “and/or”. &#x20;

(j) Counterparts. Each Party may execute this Agreement in two or more counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Each Party may deliver an executed copy of this Agreement by electronic transmission (e.g., Docusign, PDF, click-through acceptance on the Company’s website or Member Portal or similar format) to the other Party, and such delivery will have the same force and effect as any other delivery of a manually signed copy.
