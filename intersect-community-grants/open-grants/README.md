# Open grants

{% hint style="info" %}
**Our grants program is taking a pause during the summer period.** \
\
All current grantees and applicants who have applied to run a Community Hub, within the Inclusion & Accessibility or local member meet-ups are still eligible and will be contacted soon.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Community Tooling

Once implemented, [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/tree/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694) will provide a framework for on-chain decision-making for the Cardano ecosystem. These grants are designed to provide funding to build a minimal set of tools to support participation in Cardano's governance.

### The categories

The grants will cover various categories opening over the coming weeks. Each category will have a four-week application window, so keep an eye on this page if you are waiting on a different category to open. We will also announce category openings on Discord and Telegram.

_Briefs will be made available once the category opens for submissions_
