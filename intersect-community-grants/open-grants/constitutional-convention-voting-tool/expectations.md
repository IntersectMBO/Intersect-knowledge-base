# Expectations

## What a tooling provider can expect:

In addition to the above requirements (which amount to features to be exhibited by the tooling), we (the people assessing the RFP responses) will want to know how people applying for funding to build this tool intend to develop this product, e.g. testnet/ development environments, and how their team intends to test the  tooling as they develop it. We will require that the team write, follow and maintain a test plan.  We will also be interested in how the team intends to deploy their tooling and will expect some sort of deployment of features that have been developed from the first milestone.&#x20;

A representative of the team selected to build the Constitutional Convention voting tool will be required to attend a standup meeting with representatives of Input | Output (IO) between one and three times per week to report on progress and ensure a smooth delivery.&#x20;

## Notes

The above requirements assume that:

1. We build tooling
2. The tooling is built by a community member and utilises the blockchain.&#x20;

Ultimately we could decide to go with an established web 2.0 solution to achieve the same voting experience.&#x20;

It may be decided that paper ballots are feasible, Regardless these will be prepared in case of technical failure during the convention.&#x20;

The deadline for having the tooling built, tested and deployed is 15th November 2024
