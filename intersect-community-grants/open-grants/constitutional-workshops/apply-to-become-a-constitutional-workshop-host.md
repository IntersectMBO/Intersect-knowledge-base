# Apply to become a constitutional workshop host

High quality constitutional workshops are critical to the creation of a new governing document for Cardano. Intersect will award grants valued at **₳8,000 - ₳12,500 ADA** to assist in creating a productive, live event experience. Everyone is welcome to apply to become a workshop host and will be provided templates, training and materials to deliver a structured and effective workshop. In addition, each workshop will select constitutional delegates and alternates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires in December 2024.

Only Intersect members will be eligible to receive funding, but all hosts (irrespective of funding arrangements) will be supported with training and materials.

We want the scale of the global consultation effort to match the scale of the ambition - and one of Intersect’s core pillars - for Cardano’s governance to become fully community led. To achieve this, we are re-opening up applications for countries unrepresented in the current confirmed list of workshops. Our aim is to have 50+ workshops in 50 unique countries.
