# GovTool Governance Action Outcome

With on-chain governance, introduced by CIP-1694, ada holders will be empowered to submit a governance action (GA) directly onto the Cardano mainnet. This ability will transform how decisions are made for the blockchain.&#x20;

To support CIP-1694's on-chain features Intersect has facilitated the creation of key governance tools, which include Govtool and the CC Portal.\
\
To complete support for the key governance processes Intersect is providing a grant to create a Governance Action Outcomes section in Govtool.
