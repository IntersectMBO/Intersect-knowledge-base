# Grants project delays

If a project, or a specific milestone, is delayed, the grantee is required, as soon as possible, to inform the Grants team of the delay and the associated reason via [grants@intersectmbo.org](mailto:grants@intersectmbo.org). If this is a valid reason for the delay, then the Grants team will renegotiate the timeline with the grantee.

In the event of a change of scope of a project or a milestone, the grantee is required, as soon as possible, to inform the Grants team of the change and the reason associated via [grants@intersectmbo.org](mailto:grants@intersectmbo.org). If this is a valid reason for the change, then the Grants team will revisit the contract to see if a possible amendment can be made to achieve a similar outcome. If this is not possible, the project will no longer be able to progress. This process is stipulated in every grant contract.

In the event of a milestone not being completed, affecting the overall success of the project, without any valid or accepted reasoning, the grantee's Intersect membership will be revoked and this will forbid the award of any future Intersect grants.
