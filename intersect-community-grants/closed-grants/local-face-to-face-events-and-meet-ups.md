# Local face-to-face events and meet-ups

Intersect is providing a grant between 1,000-5,000 ADA for local face-to-face meet-ups that cover Intersect and Cardanoâ€™s governance.&#x20;

Following evaluation and selection of successful participants, Intersect will issue a contract with full detail of the agreement and payment/invoicing process. In this contractual agreement, Intersect will agree to distribute the Grant to the selected applicant as per the following:

a.   \[50%] with effect from the date the contractual Agreement is signed by both parties providing the grantee has provided a date for the event, a preferred venue, a draft agenda, sign-up link and a budget breakdown;

b.   \[50%] with effect from the date the Event is complete, as evidenced by the Grantee producing all remaining Deliverables listed below.

## Deliverables:

_In advance the host will be required to:_

* Confirm date and venue of Event&#x20;
* Provide agenda and share with Intersect at least 2 weeks ahead of event
* Confirm budget breakdown at least 2 weeks ahead of event
* Promote the workshop at least 2 weeks ahead of time via an online event link (e.g. luma)
* Ensure proper venue set-up

_Following the constitutional workshop, the host will be required to:_

* Produce a blog showcasing the benefit of the Event, that will be shared with Intersect for public consumption
* Photographic evidence of the event

As with any other grant, the same [application and review process will apply](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-community-grants/application-process). If you are successful, all liability and responsibility for the event will be with the host, not Intersect.
