# Functional Requirements

## Context

### High-Level Description Of Services

To ensure the effective development, deployment, and maintenance of these governance tools, we need to handle:

* Cloud service
* Infrastructure&#x20;
* Pipeline Configuration
* Orchestration and containerization
* Domain management
* Monitoring technology
* Networking configuration
* Security measures

### DevOps Strategy Highlights

DevOps Strategy focuses on optimizing development and deployment processes for a small team without a dedicated DevOps engineer. It emphasizes selecting well-tested, developer-friendly components to streamline operations, reduce operational costs, and enhance system flexibility. The strategy further defines adopting Docker containers for packaging, utilizing Docker Compose on the Hetzner cloud for small projects, and Kubernetes for more complex requirements in larger projects.&#x20;

Furthermore, GitHub for code repository and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, coupled with GitHub Secrets for secret management, handling monitoring by an open-source stack of Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki for cost-effective and efficient observability.&#x20;

The strategy also highlights the importance of documentation using GitHub Markdown pages and outlines an implementation plan that includes infrastructure setup, pipeline configuration, deployment strategies, and continuous monitoring and optimization.&#x20;

## Description of required services

All services provided by the chosen supplier must be accompanied by testing results confirming that the requirements were fully implemented.\
The supplier will support two key streams of work:

* [Implementation of DevOps Strategy](functional-requirements.md#implementation-of-devops-strategy-requirements)
* [Maintenance of the Implemented DevOps Strategy](functional-requirements.md#maintenance-of-the-implemented-devops-strategy)
* Stakeholder Alignment:\
  Ensure alignment and understanding of DevOps goals among key stakeholders, including development, operations, and leadership teams.&#x20;

The supplier must be operational within 4 weeks of the award date.
