# Metadata (from Anchor)

Metadata (from Anchor) - optional supporting data for a governance action that provides additional background and context. For example, the conversations surrounding a proposal could become metadata for when it is posted as a governance action on-chain. The final structure and standards to follow in relation to metadata will be given by the [governance metadata CIP](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556).
