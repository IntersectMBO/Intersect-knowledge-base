# Governance Action (GA)

Governance Action (GA) - the on-chain action available for on-chain voting enabled by the implementation of CIP-1694. There are seven different actions specified within [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/tree/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694). GAs are enacted when on-chain votes approve them. GAs are what users submit votes on.
