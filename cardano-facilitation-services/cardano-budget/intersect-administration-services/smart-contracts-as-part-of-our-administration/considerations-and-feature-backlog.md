# Considerations and feature backlog

## Considerations

Given the novel decentralized approach to oversight and the constitutional requirement for traditional written contracts, several considerations must be understood.&#x20;

* Most importantly, it should be understood that these smart contracts effectively hold money in a transparent on-chain ‘escrow.’ When held in these smart contracts, the treasury funds are never initially in an Intersect account or wallet. These smart contracts lock the ability to stake and delegate.&#x20;
* Vendors must be aware of how oversight works before signing any contract and how it may affect disbursement or modification. They are consulted before the oversight committee agrees on their particular partition/treasury contract and/or vendor contract.&#x20;
* Vendors have representation in smart contracts. Not all smart contract actions can be unilaterally undertaken against a vendor. There needs to be a mutual agreement with vendors before smart contracts can be agreed upon, funded, and modified. Some specific actions require a vendor signature via a key before they can be enacted.
* Each escrow environment or treasury contract may have a unique oversight committee makeup and unique permissions. This allows for a level of future-proofing. These smart contracts enable more unique use cases as needed, which can be legally permitted over time. &#x20;

## Feature Backlog

These smart contracts, designed to manage treasury funding are new. The team already have plenty of ideas for additional features and use cases.
