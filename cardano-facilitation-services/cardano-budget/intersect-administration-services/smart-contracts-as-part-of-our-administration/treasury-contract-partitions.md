# Treasury contract partitions

## Treasury Contract Partitions

Funds can be partitioned into Treasury Contracts at any time; they can be specified in the treasury withdrawal governance action, or funds can be moved into smart contracts at a later date. This latter option may be used to smooth the adoption and risk of a big-bang approach. It is expected that several partitions or slices of funds will ultimately be used.\


These can be themed arbitrarily but are expected to follow some logic, either thematically, by use, or most likely phases of deployment, such as ‘2025 Budget Proposals’. However, there are multiple possibilities for now and in the future. An illustration is provided below.\
