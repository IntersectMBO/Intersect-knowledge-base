# Intersect as an Administrator

Intersect serves as an Administrator within Cardanoâ€™s funding ecosystem, helping to operationalize community-approved proposals by coordinating due diligence, contracting, and on-chain disbursements. This role is grounded in the principles of transparency, decentralization, and adherence to the Cardano Constitution.&#x20;

Intersect does not evaluate proposal merit or act as a funding body, but ensures that the governance process is carried out with integrity and that delivery is trackable, auditable, and aligned with community decisions.\
\
We've prepared a pack to expand in much more detail, and look forward to continue iterating our role to suit the demands and needs of the Cardano ecosystem.
