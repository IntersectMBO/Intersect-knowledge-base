# Intersect as an Administrator

Serving as an administrator in Cardano's funding process, Intersect helps turn community-approved projects into reality by handling the behind-the-scenes work - checking credentials, setting up contracts, and ensuring funds are spent in line with the contract.

Intersect does not evaluate proposal merit or act as a funding body, but ensures that the governance process is carried out with integrity and that delivery is trackable, auditable, and aligned with community decisions.\
\
We've prepared a detailed pack with more information, and look forward to continuously improving our role to meet the needs of the Cardano ecosystem.
