# How to submit Milestone Evidence and Withdraw Milestones

At this point your vendor smart contract should already be deployed and active.&#x20;

Your vendor smart contract commits your project and delivery schedule; milestone name, deliverable, payment date and amount, immutably to the Cardano blockchain. This metadata and any subsequent agreed changes will be publicly available.&#x20;

The following instructions will step you through how to submit evidence and withdraw a milestone payment.&#x20;

These instructions can only be completed by the credential associated with your vendor smart contract.&#x20;

## Step 1:

In your pre-agreed communication channel with the Intersect Delivery Assurance team, vendors should provide a completed Milestone Acceptance Form (MAF) for each individual milestone on or before the **Milestone Completion Date** as set out in your legal contract.&#x20;

_**Best practice tip:**_ It is advised to template these MAFs out for each milestone in advance, share them and work on them in transparency with the delivery assurance team. Intersect may be able to provide feedback throughout the process, not just at the end, this is likely to speed up the review and acceptance process.&#x20;

The delivery assurance team will review and provide acceptance that the attestation provided in the MAF meets the deliverables and acceptance criteria from your legal contract.

If accepted:&#x20;

* The delivery assurance team will host your MAF and provide a link to your completed MAF. This link will be used later when submitting evidence on-chain. Continue to step 2.

(Optionally, if agreed with the delivery assurance team, the vendor may host and provide a link to the completed MAF themselves)

If **not** accepted or a MAF has not been provided by the Milestone Completion date:

* The delivery assurance team will provide feedback as to why the MAF is not acceptable and provide remediation steps for the vendor to compete
* If a MAF is not provided at all the delivery assurance team will recommend that the current and all future milestones be paused

## Step 2:

Navigate to the Smart Contract Administration Dashboard, URL: [https://treasury.sundae.fi/instances](https://treasury.sundae.fi/instances) and Log In using the wallet/credential that you provided within your legal contract.&#x20;

## Step 3:

Navigate to your vendor smart contract. The ‘Contract Name’ will be similar or an abbreviated version of your legal contract name.&#x20;

In some cases where a vendor has multiple successful projects the name may be a combination of all successful project names. Also longer projects may be broken down into smaller smart contracts (the vendor will have one legal contract and multiple smart contracts), in these instances the project names should be agreed in advance.

Smart contracts where your credential has available actions will be highlighted:

* Example of a claimable milestone. ‘Instances’ > ‘Intersect Treasury Reserve Contracts 1’, highlighted below in green
* Open your vendor smart contract, continue to step 4

## Step 4:

Click on the button to ‘Submit Evidence’, highlighted green below.

Completed the pop-up form.

* Milestone: Select the milestone the evidence is supportive of, as in some instances you have multiple milestones which require evidence being submitted
* Title: Enter an appropriate title for the evidence, you should include the Milestone Number and Name as per your legal contract
* Evidence URL: Enter the link pre-agreed with the Delivery Assurance team from step 1. This URL will point to your completed Milestone Acceptance Form (MAF)

Once completed click the ‘Submit Evidence’ button. You may be asked to sign a transaction submitting the evidence to on-chain.&#x20;

Failure to submit a MAF on or before the Milestone Completion Date to the delivery assurance team, or failure to submit a form at all, may result in the vendor smart contract Payment Date being paused.&#x20;

Many organisations are still required to submit and process invoices. Please submit invoices within 5 working days of your Milestone Completion Date as per your legal contract, following the instructions within your contract.&#x20;

In certain circumstances failure to submit invoices may also result in your smart contract payment date milestones being paused and ultimately funds may be delayed.&#x20;

## Step 5:

Once evidence has been submitted you may select the option to ‘Withdraw All Available Payments’

Follow the actions as prompted to withdraw any milestone payment dates which have matured.&#x20;

Note, withdrawing milestones without providing evidence may result in all subsequent milestones being paused.&#x20;
