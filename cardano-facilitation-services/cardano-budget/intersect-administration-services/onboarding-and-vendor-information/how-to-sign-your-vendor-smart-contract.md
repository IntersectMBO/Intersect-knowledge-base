# How to sign your Vendor Smart Contract

Following on-chain governance action voting and the signing of a traditional legal contract, the last administrative step in setting up your delivery is to sign the Smart Contract version of your Contract.&#x20;

This commits your project and delivery schedule; milestone name, deliverable, payment date and amount, immutably to the Cardano blockchain. This metadata and any subsequent agreed changes will be publicly available.&#x20;

Please carefully read each of the 3 steps outlined below and complete the signing of your vendor smart contract.&#x20;

This must be completed within 36 hours of the smart contract being deployed by Intersect.

## Step 1:

Navigate to the Smart Contract Administration Dashboard, URL: [https://treasury.sundae.fi/instances](https://treasury.sundae.fi/instances) and Log In using the wallet/credential that you provided within your legal contract.&#x20;

## Step 2:

Navigate to your vendor smart contract. The ‘Contract Name’ will be similar or an abbreviated version of your legal contract name.&#x20;

In some cases where a vendor has multiple successful projects the name may be a combination of all successful project names. Also longer projects may be broken down into smaller smart contracts (the vendor will have one legal contract and multiple smart contracts), in these instances the project names should be agreed in advance.

Outstanding or pending actions will also be highlighted once signed into the administration dashboard. The UI may show this in multiple ways:

* Highlighted to the right under ‘Your Action Items’, highlighted below in red
* ‘Action Items’ in the main navigation panel to the left

Please ensure you check all the details of the smart contract, Project Name, Project Description and the delivery schedule; milestone name, deliverable, payment date and amount, highlighted green below.

If you have multiple smart contracts you will see multiple actions, these should all be completed individually.&#x20;

Note: currently the smart contract will only contain milestone payment date, not milestone delivery date.&#x20;

If the information **IS CORRECT** - sign the action per the administration dashboard prompts, highlighted orange above.&#x20;

If the information **IS NOT** correct - do nothing on the administration dashboard, do not sign the contract. Alert the Intersect Delivery Assurance team via the communication channels established with you as a vendor or email the team at [delivery@intersectmbo.org](mailto:delivery@intersectmbo.org).

Please detail the issues or discrepancies found.&#x20;

The action request to sign your vendor smart contract will be available for 36 hours following deployment, if you do not sign your contract within this period the process will need to be restarted and the request sent again.
