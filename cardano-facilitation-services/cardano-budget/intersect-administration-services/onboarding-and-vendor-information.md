# Onboarding & Vendor Information

This page is designed for vendors whose proposals have been ratified and enacted, and who now have both a legal written contract and a corresponding smart contract in place. Here, you’ll find our Vendor Onboarding Pack — a comprehensive guide that explains how Intersect will welcome you into the process, outline the steps for getting started, and detail how we will administer your contract from initiation through to successful delivery.

Each vendor will be invited to an onboarding call with Intersect's delivery assurance team to onboard you and provide you with the opportunity to ask any questions you may have.
