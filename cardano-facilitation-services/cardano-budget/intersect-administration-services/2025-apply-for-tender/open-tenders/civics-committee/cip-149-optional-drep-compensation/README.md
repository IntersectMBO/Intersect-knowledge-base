# CIP-149 Optional DRep Compensation

Intersect is launching a small-grant program to accelerate adoption of CIP-149 (Optional DRep Compensation) across the ecosystem.

This initiative is designed to pilot a low-cost, opt-in, data-driven mechanism that enables Ada holders to voluntarily donate a portion of their staking rewards to their chosen Delegated Representative (DRep). Insights from this program will inform future decisions on ledger-level incentives and broader governance participation.
