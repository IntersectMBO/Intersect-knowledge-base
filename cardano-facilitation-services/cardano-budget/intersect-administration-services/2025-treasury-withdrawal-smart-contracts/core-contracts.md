<table><thead><tr><th width="123">Vendor</th><th width="171">Contract Name</th><th width="352">Contract Description</th><th width="122">Contract Amount (ADA)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Catalyst FC</td><td>Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised<br>Community Innovation Funding &#x26; Infrastructure</td><td>The Supplier will run a grants program known as Project Catalyst, which includes inviting interested parties to submit proposals as part of three funding rounds (Fund 14, Fund 15, and Fund 16). The Supplier, through its appointed administrator, will provide a platform to support the program, manage its operations and carry out all necessary activities to ensure the effective execution of the program—from fund launch through to project reporting.</td><td>64,300,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cooperativa de Trabajo Eryx LTDA,</td><td>ZK Bridge</td><td>This Grantee will build a ZK bridge for Cardano, which Grantee will deploy on the Cardano testnet. As part of this initiative, Grantee will define a communication protocol for the bridge, provide the full source code of the smart contracts on the Cardano side, and produce comprehensive technical documentation detailing the protocol between Cardano and any other isomorphic blockchain.</td><td>700,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dmytro Stashenko</td><td>AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer</td><td>We propose to continue development and support of the AdaStat.net Cardano<br>blockchain explorer for the next 24 months. Planned work includes performance<br>optimizations, improvements to UX/UI, and new features related to Cardano’s evolving<br>governance model and on-chain tooling.</td><td>212,000</td></tr><tr><td>FAIR IO</td><td>PyCardano</td><td>The PyCardano maintenance project, as outlined in the proposal, is structured as a<br>year-long service level agreement. The core objective is to ensure the library's continuous<br>reliability, compatibility with the evolving Cardano network, and ongoing support for the developer community.</td><td>314,800</td></tr><tr><td>Harmonic Laboratories</td><td>Gerolamo - Cardano Node in typescript</td><td>The scope of the project is to create a Cardano data node that can run in the browser. Cardano data node implies a subset of features of a full node, mainly the ability to follow the tip of the chain and update the local ledger state accordingly, while replaying to queries from the end user. The ability to have a data node in the browser minimizes the trust required to<br>interact with the cardano blockchain from any app that uses it.</td><td>578,571</td></tr><tr><td>Informatik Mündler,</td><td>OpShin - Python Smart Contracts for Cardano</td><td><p>OpShin is a toolchain that lets developers construct Cardano smart contracts in Python. The toolchain comprises several projects that aim to facilitate the development of Smart Contracts and dApps on Cardano. They are largely based on Python, or integrate well with it for maximal accessibility. On top of accessibility, OpShin ensures low transaction cost compared to PlutusTx. </p><p><br>OpShin enforces strict typing on the high-level programming: it implements a type system on top of Python type hints. However, all traces of typing are erased during compilation, for a maximum efficiency program. OpShin beats many programming languages when taken to<br>the test for real use-cases.</p></td><td>199,911</td></tr><tr><td>IOE</td><td>2025 Input Output Engineering Core Development Proposal</td><td>The Supplier will provide comprehensive engineering, maintenance, and development services to enhance and secure the Cardano protocol and its core infrastructure. The services are focused on delivering the community-endorsed technical roadmap and maintaining network stability.</td><td>96,817,080</td></tr><tr><td>IOG</td><td>Input Output Research (IOR): Cardano Vision - Work Program 2025</td><td>The Supplier will provide a strategic program of research and development designed to<br>realizeCardano Vision and place Cardano at the forefront of blockchain innovation. The<br>services are designed to deliver foundational research and technology validation<br>workstreams up to SRL5, alongside communication and dissemination activities.</td><td>26,840,000</td></tr><tr><td>IOG</td><td>Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal</td><td>Blockfrost aims to decentralize its Cardano Blockchain API through the Blockfrost Platform and Blockfrost Gateway, enabling a network of Icebreakers operated by SPOs and node operators to process API requests and share revenue. All components are open-sourced to ensure transparency and avoid vendor lock-in.</td><td>1,300,000</td></tr><tr><td>IOG</td><td>Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised<br>Community Innovation Funding &#x26; Infrastructure</td><td>The Supplier will provide design and development services to deliver a comprehensive technical upgrade to the Project Catalyst platform. These services are designed to overhaul both the user<br>experiences and the underlying engine of the system.</td><td>5,159,000</td></tr><tr><td>Vellum Labs</td><td>Developer-Focused Blockchain Explorer for Cardano</td><td>Cexplorer.io is already live and actively maintained by an experienced team of backend, frontend, and infrastructure developers. This proposal includes funding for ongoing maintenance, including server infrastructure, performance monitoring, bug fixes, and updates aligned with Cardano protocol changes.</td><td>266,667</td></tr><tr><td>zkFold SA,</td><td>zkFold ZK Rollup - zkFold SA</td><td>zkFold will develop and implement ZK rollups on Cardano to scale it efficiently, promoting broader adoption and supporting an ecosystem of decentralized applications and services.</td><td>1,161,000</td></tr></tbody></table>
