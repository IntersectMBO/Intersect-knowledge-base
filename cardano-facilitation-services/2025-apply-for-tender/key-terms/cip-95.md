# CIP-95

[CIP-95](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0095/README.md) - This CIP extends the CIP-30 API to add specific support for governance functionality. This allows sharing of DRep identifying keys between wallets and dApps to allow dApps to identify users who have registered as DReps on-chain.
