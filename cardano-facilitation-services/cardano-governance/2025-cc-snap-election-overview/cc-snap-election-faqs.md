# CC Snap Election FAQs

## **Snap Election FAQ**

<details>

<summary>Why is a snap election being held?</summary>

A Constitutional Committee member (Cardano Atlantic Council) has announced their retirement effective 25 November 2025. This reduces the Committee below the minimum size required by protocol parameters (committeeMinSize = 7), triggering the need to elect a replacement to maintain constitutional continuity.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the Constitutional Committee and why does size matter?</summary>

The CC confirms or rejects governance actions according to their constitutionality. The protocol requires at least seven active members to validate governance actions. Falling below this minimum pauses the governance process, until a replacement has been elected.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why are we electing just one member? Wouldn’t adding more reduce the risk of this happening again?</summary>

This snap election is only intended to replace the single seat vacated by the Cardano Atlantic Council. Snap elections are designed to restore the Constitutional Committee to its required minimum size, not to change its structure.

Any decision to increase the number of CC members, or to adjust the minimum committee size parameter, needs clear community consent and must go through the proper governance process. Intersect will explore these broader questions separately through the appropriate mechanisms.
