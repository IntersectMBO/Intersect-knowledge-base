**How it works:**

* Candidates may submit a link to a short Proof-of-Life video, or confirm they were a previous candidate in the [2025 CC election](../2025-constitutional-committee-elections/).
* Once checked, the PoL requirement is considered satisfied, even if no video link is provided.
* **Consortium Exemption Rule:** If 50% or more of a consortium’s members were candidates (solo or as part of a team) in the [2025 CC election](../2025-constitutional-committee-elections/), the consortium qualifies for an automatic PoL exemption. These members may check the exemption box when submitting.
