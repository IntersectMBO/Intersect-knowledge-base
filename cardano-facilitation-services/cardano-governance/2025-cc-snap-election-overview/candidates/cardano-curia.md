The mission of the Cardano Curia Constitutional Committee is to maintain a stable, predictable, and community-aligned governance framework during a period of accelerated ecosystem growth. This consortium exists to safeguard Cardano’s Constitution by providing balanced, principled, and community-focused oversight throughout the interim period. Our role is to ensure that governance actions remain faithful to Cardano’s core values of decentralization, transparency, and inclusivity, while protecting the chain from short-term risks and bad-faith proposals and supporting practical, builder-driven governance maturity.

We focus on maintaining rigorous, neutral, and timely review of constitutional actions, including Treasury Withdrawals and NCLs, so that builders, users, and partners can advance confidently. By supporting reliable governance operations, we help enable ecosystem growth and reinforce the foundations needed for Cardano’s long-term success.\
Values:\
Our work is anchored in a community-first ethos that places the long-term health and resilience of Cardano above any personal or narrow interests. Integrity is our foundation, guiding impartial action and full constitutional alignment. We apply evidence-based judgment, relying on data, precedent, and reasoned debate to ensure decisions are both rigorous and defensible.\
We value inclusivity and diversity, reflecting a group of builders and business professionals from multiple continents, backgrounds, and roles across the ecosystem. This breadth of perspective strengthens our ability to serve the global Cardano community. Our approach is shaped by radical transparency: every vote, decision, and rationale will be clearly communicated in accessible language so the community can easily understand and verify our reasoning.\
As temporary custodians of a critical governance function, we recognize our responsibility to support decentralization, mitigate risk, and uphold trust. We view our role as community stewardship, operating professionally and openly while enabling Cardano’s continued growth and evolution.

Evidence-based judgment – Decisions grounded in data, precedent, and reasoned debate.\
Inclusivity & diversity – Representing builders from multiple continents, backgrounds, and ecosystem roles.\
