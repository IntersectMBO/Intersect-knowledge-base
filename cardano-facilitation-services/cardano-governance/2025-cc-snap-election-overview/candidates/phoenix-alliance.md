About Phoenix Alliance\
Phoenix Alliance is a newly formed consortium created through the unification of two respected governance groups in the Cardano ecosystem: Adara and the CCC. Both groups stood in the previous Constitutional Committee election, placing 8th and 9th respectively (with seven seats available). Following the unexpected vacancy on the Constitutional Committee and the need for a snap election, members from both consortia reflected deeply on how best to serve the ecosystem at this critical moment.\
In recent months, both groups faced significant losses, Adara through the departure of two core members, and CCC through the passing of one of their valued members. This change in composition meant neither group could stand independently in the snap election in a way that honoured their original commitments.\
Instead of stepping back, we choose to step forward together.\
Phoenix Alliance represents the merging of the remaining members of both consortia into a single, stronger, coordinated team, united by shared values, complementary expertise, and a belief that Cardano governance is most resilient when its contributors collaborate rather than compete.\
Like our namesake, Phoenix Alliance stands for renewal, continuity, and transformation. We carry forward the knowledge, experience, and ethos of both Adara and CCC while building something new, specifically formed to serve the Cardano community in this moment and to strengthen the long-term foundations of decentralized governance.

Phoenix has formed as a collective of committed governance contributors, united by a shared responsibility to uphold and advance decentralized governance on Cardano. In response to the needs of the ecosystem, we have come together to ensure continuity, resilience, and principled stewardship during this pivotal transition.\
