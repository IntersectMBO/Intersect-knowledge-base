<table><thead><tr><th width="145">Contract</th><th width="118">Duration</th><th width="114">Progress</th><th>Summary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>IOI - CIP-1649 , Backlog &#x26; Cardano Node Maintenance</td><td>1st Jan 24 - 31st Jan 25</td><td>2 / 4 Quarters complete</td><td>Enables continuation of development of CIP 1694 hard fork in addition to other development work to maintain the network.</td></tr><tr><td>WellTyped - LSM  1, 2, 3 &#x26; 4</td><td>24th Aug 23 - 13th Dec 24</td><td>7/11 Milestones Complete</td><td>This work develops new Log Structured Merge Tree implementations that will enable long-term scalability and sustainability for the Cardano node, by allowing large data structures to be stored externally to the node (eg on disk/SSD), but in a way that allows the data to be accessed efficiently when it is required.</td></tr><tr><td>Galois - Halo 2</td><td>31st July 23 - 17th June 24 [Delayed]</td><td>4/5 Milestones Complete</td><td>Halo 2 eliminates the need for a trusted setup. Development of Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for future interoperability of the Cardano economy. This contract supports work on repeatedly refining proof obligations until a base obligation can be discharged.</td></tr><tr><td>Tweag - Genesis</td><td>1st Jan 24 - 31st May 24</td><td>6/8 Milestone Complete</td><td>Ouroboros Genesis mechanism: will enable new nodes to join the Cardano blockchain and bootstrap themselves without needing to rely on a trusted service. It also allows nodes to become disconnected and re-join the network in the same way.</td></tr><tr><td>EMURGO - Serialization Library, Yoroi Extension Wallet, Yoroi Mobile Wallet, Educational Materials</td><td>1st Jan 24 - 31st Jan 25</td><td>9/16 Milestones Complete</td><td>EMURGO produces Educational Materials which will cover every aspect of CIP 1694, testing and support of the Cardano Serialisation library, Yoroi Extension &#x26; Mobile Wallet</td></tr><tr><td>Tweag - OpenSource</td><td>17th Jan - 15th May 24</td><td>4/4 Milestones Complete</td><td>Conducted an assessment and provided advisory services to Intersect to develop the vision and strategy of the Open Source Program Office(“OSPO”), ensuring a successful transition for Cardano into an open-source environment</td></tr><tr><td>VacLabs - Ledger &#x26; Trezor hardware wallets</td><td>10th May 24 - 13th Mar 24<br>[Delayed]</td><td>4/6 Milestones Completed</td><td>Ensuring the continued practical use of the Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets for the Cardano community and enhancements to support the Conway era</td></tr><tr><td>DQuadrant HF Testing</td><td>10th May 24 - 17th July 24</td><td>7/7 Milestones Completed</td><td>Supporting Chang hard fork development activities by performing regression testing and testing of new features</td></tr><tr><td>Tweag - BlockFetch</td><td>20th May 24 - July 24</td><td>0/2 Milestones Completed</td><td>Developing a modification to the block fetch decision logic to ensure analogous responsiveness from block fetch peers.<br>A report on how to identify a certain type of attack and what actions could be taken to mitigate such it.</td></tr><tr><td>Tweag - Guardrails</td><td>20th May 24 - July 24</td><td>0/1 Milestones Completed</td><td>Tweag will provide IOG with audits for the Guardrail script which handles a filtering of users' proposals before being subjected to votes</td></tr><tr><td>Tweag - Identity Management</td><td>20th May 24 - Aug 24</td><td>0/1 Milestones Completed</td><td>Tweag will provide IOG with audits for the Identity management script which is an overlay. This script thus relies on the latest PlutusV3 features around governance.</td></tr><tr><td>Bitergia - Interactive Ecosystem Visualizations</td><td>Feb 24- Dec 24</td><td>3/6</td><td>Analyzing the footprint and ecosystem network of a client's open source community on GitHub to identify collaboration opportunities, visualize resource interdependence, and integrate external projects into an open dataset</td></tr></tbody></table>
