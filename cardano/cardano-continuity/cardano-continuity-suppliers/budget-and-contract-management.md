# Budget and contract management

### **Introduction**

The purpose of Intersect’s Core Services is to support committee projects by managing contract processes and overseeing budgets. Our approach ensures compliance, transparency, and effective management of resources, enabling committees to focus on their objectives. **This process will be implemented once the Treasury withdrawal has been approved.**



### Core Services Team Structure

Below is a diagram showing how the Core Services Team in Intersect have been setup to support the committees with their contracts and budgets.

### Budget Management

The Budget Committee is responsible for ensuring that the community-approved budget is effectively managed, tracked, and delivered according to mandates. While they oversee these budgets, Intersect’s Core Services team handles the operational expenditures. Key responsibilities include:

* **Budget Sheet Management**: Each committee has a dedicated budget sheet tracking expenditures.
* **Procurement & Delivery Tracking**: Monitoring each phase of contract completion.
* **Legal & Invoicing Support**: Managing contracts, invoicing, and financial documentation.
* **Forecasting & Reporting**: Ensuring transparency and financial accountability

### Contract Management

Intersect Core Services oversees the entire bid and contract management process, from initial proposals to final completion. We work closely with each committee to ensure clear communication, tracking, and timely project delivery.

### Core Processes

#### Who can evaluate?

Community members are welcome to volunteer to support the evaluation of a bid, provided they meet the following criteria:

* Member of Intersect (respect of the code of conduct)
* Have applied to be an evaluator through the agreed format (TBC format)
* Member of the Committee if the Committee have agreed to evaluate internally for special circumstances (e.g. TSC)

These members will constitute the evaluation review board.

### Contract Management

Once a contract has been signed by all parties, the Core Services Delivery Assurance team will manage the contract.

### Financial Transparency

To ensure transparency, we propose a quarterly meeting with the CC/DReps where will be walk them through how Intersect is managing the budgets. The transparency is to be provided in a Quarterly Financial Report. The financial report will outline the committee budget’s progress - all of which will have been previously approved. \
