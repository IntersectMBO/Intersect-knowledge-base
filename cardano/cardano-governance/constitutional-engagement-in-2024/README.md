# Constitutional engagement in 2024

## Developing an interim Constitution for Cardano

Until a final Cardano Constitution has been developed and ratified by the community and a [Constitutional Committee](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/governance-roles/constitutional-committee) is up and running - a programme of consultation that will take place during 2024 - a set of interim rules will be required to support the transition. The interim Constitution will define both the on-chain ‘technical’ and the off-chain ‘governance’ guardrails needed to maintain the security and reliability of the blockchain. Without an interim Constitution, the interim Constitutional Committee cannot fulfill its role in ensuring (within a limited scope) the constitutionality and technical soundness of on-chain governance actions.&#x20;

The process to develop an interim Constitution started by defining both technical and governance guardrails within committees of [Intersect](https://intersectmbo.org/).  As the steering bodies within this organization, committees provide recommendations for the Cardano community. Once finalized, the content of the interim Constitution will be included in the Chang upgrade (see [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694#abstract) or our recent article on the [milestones and key terms](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/cardanos-governance-key-terms-and-milestones)). Also, development is underway for technical guardrails within a smart contract framework, which will support the interim Constitution on-chain.
