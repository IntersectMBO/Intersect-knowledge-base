High quality constitutional workshops are critical to the creation of a new governing document for Cardano. Intersect will award grants valued at **₳8,000 - ₳12,500 ADA** to assist in creating a productive, live event experience. Everyone is welcome to apply to become a workshop host and will be provided templates, training and materials to deliver a structured and effective workshop. In addition, each workshop will select constitutional delegates and alternates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires in December 2024.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Intersect members will be eligible to receive funding, but all hosts (irrespective of funding arrangements) will be supported with training and materials.
{% endhint %}

As with any other Intersect grant, the same[ application and review process will apply](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-community-grants/application-process). If selected, the Cardano Civics Committee expects the host to plan and execute a live event experience for their community.&#x20;
