# SanchoNet

SanchoNet is all about developing and testing the _technical_ components and processes required to action governance for Cardano within CIP-1694. It informs and engages the Cardano community on Voltaire on-chain governance activities currently underway.

SanchoNet will evolve from a testnet into a collaborative platform where ideas become reality and contributions enrich the ecosystem, fostering fully decentralized decision making. You can read more and get involved [here](https://sancho.network).&#x20;
