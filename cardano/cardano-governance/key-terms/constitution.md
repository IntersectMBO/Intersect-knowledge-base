# Constitution

A constitution is a collection of rule sets that determine how laws are enacted, administered, and adjudicated in a given society. Throughout history, constitutions have played a key role in establishing and delineating a Governmentâ€™s structural framework, defining the different branches and their respective powers and responsibilities. A constitution both provides the framework for collective decision making and typically incorporates design features that should reduce the costs of collective decision making at scale. As Cardano is a community-led ecosystem, it is imperative that its Constitution is enacted for the benefit and protection of the entire ecosystem.&#x20;

The Constitution will provide the framework and guardrails for collective decision making. It will also define the rights and principles for those participating in the Cardano ecosystem and provide the foundation to meet current and future demands that come with a maturing ecosystem.
