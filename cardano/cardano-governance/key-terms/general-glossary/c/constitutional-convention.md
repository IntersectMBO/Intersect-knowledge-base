# Constitutional Convention

The Cardano Constitutional Convention event will occur in Buenos Aires in 2024 as part of the journey towards a ratified Cardano constitution.

Constitutional conventions exist to discuss and define a draft constitution, which will be proposed for an on-chain vote.

A historical parallel for 2024's Cardano Constitutional Convention can be drawn with the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, held in Philadelphia. Following intense debate, the convention resulted in the signing of the first draft of the U.S. Constitution on September 17. The new Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation and proposed an entirely new form of government.
