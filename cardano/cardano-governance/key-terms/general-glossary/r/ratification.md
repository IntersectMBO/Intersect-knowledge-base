# Ratification

Governance actions are ratified through on-chain voting actions. While different kinds of governance actions have different requirements, ratification always involves two of the three governance bodies (DReps, Constitutional Committee, and SPOs), except for a hard-fork initiation, which requires ratification by all governance bodies.&#x20;

Depending on the type of governance action, an action will  be ratified when a combination of the following occurs:

* the Constitutional Committee (CC) approves of the action (the number of 'Yes' votes meets the CC’s threshold)
* the DReps approve of the action (the stake controlled by the DReps who vote 'Yes' meets a certain threshold of the total active voting stake)
* the SPOs approve of the action (the stake controlled by the SPOs who vote 'Yes' meets a certain threshold over the total registered voting stake)

The ratification period is the time that elapses between a governance action being submitted and its ratification.
