The Constitutional Committee (CC) is one of the three groups responsible for ratifying governance actions under CIP-1694 alongside SPOs and DReps. CIP-1694 defines the CC as a committee that represents a set of individuals or entities that are collectively responsible for ensuring that the Constitution's principles are upheld and enforced.

The CC reviews, under a limited scope, the constitutionality of governance actions. The CC are a formal group sitting outside of Intersect and fulfils their role independently.
