# Interim CC FAQs

{% hint style="info" %}
FAQs will regularly be updated depending on member and community feedback
{% endhint %}

### Do I have to be an Intersect member to register?

No, the process is open to any individual or organization from the Cardano community.

### Will candidates be screened after registering?

Yes. Candidates will be required to answer a short set of questions to confirm technical competency to serve on the interim CC and a screening process will remove obvious junk applications.

### What roles will the pioneer entities and Intersect play on the committee?&#x20;

It is for each interim CC member individually to decide how to perform its role, within the remit of the committee.

### How else can I get my voice heard?

There are many ways to have your say on the development of Cardanoâ€™s governance:

* Join [Intersect](https://intersectmbo.org/), and contribute through community-focused committees, and working groups, including groups involved in creating a constitution draft that feeds into a broad community consultation process leading up to ratification.
* Continue to test governance features on [sanchonet.md](../../../sanchonet.md "mention")
* Find out how you can attend one of 50 global workshops to input on the draft Constitution [here](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/have-your-say-kicking-off-global-workshops-to-draft-the-final-constitution).
* Apply for[ funding opportunities](https://www.intersectmbo.org/grants) at Intersect to support the rollout through community tooling and other community initiatives.
