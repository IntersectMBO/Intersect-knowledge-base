# Constitutional Convention draft working version

The Cardano Constitutional Convention is being held between December 4-6 2024. On December 3, delegates, alternates, and members from the interim Constitutional Committee held a final in-person synthesis session to make further refinements to the draft text published on November 20th.

At the conclusion of Day 1, the working version below will go through further refinements, with a version available for delegates to consider on Day 2 (December 5, 2024) when voting opens.
