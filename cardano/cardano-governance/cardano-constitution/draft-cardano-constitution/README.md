The draft Cardano Constitution is the ongoing product of the Cardano Constitution Consultation period.

The Cardano Constitution Consultation period spans all of 2024 and summarised in the roadmap below:

The first half of 2024 included work across Intersect committees and staff to prepare for the latter half of 2024 where broad community engagement is taking place. The Cardano Civics Committee and Parameters Committee have collaborated to prepare the Interim Constitution for the Chang upgrade.  The Cardano Civics Committee, working with several relevant experts, have evaluated the Interim Constitution to identify areas for improvement, and develop a draft Constitution that align with Cardanoâ€™s vision for a decentralised, inclusive, and transparent governance structure.  The Draft Constitution serves as critical input for the Constitutional Workshops.

Starting in August and ending by Oct 15th, the Constitutional Workshops were a series of community hosted workshops designed with two objectives:

1. Gather broad and diverse community input on the Draft Constitution.
2. Select Constitutional Delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Dec. 2024. Each workshop selected a ranked list of 5 candidates. First place is the Voting Delegate, 2nd place is the Travelling Alternate, 3rd place is the Backup Alternate #1, 4th place is the Backup Alternate #2, and 5th place is the Backup Alternate #3.

Each constitutional workshop were conducted to address specific outstanding questions related to the Draft constitution.  Through structured discussions and interactive sessions, more than 1400 attendees responded to important questions that could not be resolved without broad community input. These workshops developed actionable recommendations that later became synthesised to guide updates to the Draft Constitution. Constitutional Delegates are responsible for reviewing the updated draft at the Constitutional Convention to approve to proceed for on-chain voting.
