# Guide for Applicants

Introduction

Welcome potential candidates! This guide provides essential information for those considering applying for a seat on the Constitutional Committee (CC). The CC plays a vital role in upholding the Cardano Constitution and guiding the evolution of its governance framework. Whether you are an individual Ada owner, part of a group, or representing a company, this guide outlines the eligibility requirements, the application process, the election mechanism, how to apply, and the key dates for the election cycle. We encourage all interested and eligible community members to consider this unique opportunity to contribute directly to Cardano's future.

#### Who Can Apply and How Election Works

The opportunity to help shape the future of Cardano's governance by serving on the Constitutional Committee is open to any Ada owner. Whether you hold a small amount or a large amount, you are eligible to put yourself forward as a candidate.

In this election, all seven seats are up for vote.

Election to the Committee is determined through a stake-based voting system. This means that the voting power associated with Ada holdings delegated to specific candidates will determine the outcome. The candidates who garner the most support from the community, weighted by stake, will be elected.

The election results will determine both who serves and the length of their initial term:

* The top three (3) candidates receiving the highest number of votes will be elected for a term of 126 epochs.
* The next four (4) candidates, ranked 4th through 7th in the vote count, will be elected for a term of 73 epochs.

#### Optional Tasks to Demonstrate Capabilities

In addition to the main application requirements, candidates have the opportunity to undertake an optional three-step task. Completing this task allows applicants to demonstrate key skills relevant to the CC role: technical proficiency in credential management (Steps 1 & 2) and the analytical ability to evaluate governance actions within Cardano's framework (Step 3), all performed in the SanchoNet environment. The overall objective is to successfully generate cold credentials, authorize hot credentials using them, and then use the hot credentials to evaluate, vote on, and justify a position on a governance action on SanchoNet, submitting a URL to the required evidence.\
