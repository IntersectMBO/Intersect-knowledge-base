# Guide for Applicants

**Introduction**

Welcome potential candidates! This guide provides essential information for those considering applying for a seat on the Constitutional Committee (CC). The CC plays a vital role in upholding the Cardano Constitution and guiding the evolution of its governance framework. Whether you are an individual Ada owner, part of a group, or representing a company, this guide outlines the eligibility requirements, the application process, the election mechanism, how to apply, and the key dates for the election cycle. We encourage all interested and eligible community members to consider this unique opportunity to contribute directly to Cardano's future.

**Who Can Apply and How Election Works**

The opportunity to help shape the future of Cardano's governance by serving on the Constitutional Committee is open to any Ada owner. Whether you hold a small amount or a large amount, you are eligible to put yourself forward as a candidate.

In this election, all seven seats are up for vote.

In response to community feedback and to maintain consistency with evolving governance procedures, the election to the Committee will be determined through a DRep-based voting system. This official change means that Delegated Representatives (DReps) will vote to select the members of the Constitutional Committee. The candidates who garner the most support from the DReps will be elected. DReps will be able to cast their votes using hot wallets, cold wallets, and the command-line interface (CLI).

As constitutionally mandated to ensure continuity, there are a total of seven (7) seats available on the Committee, with staggered term lengths for this election only. Three (3) of these seats are for a term of 146 epochs (approximately two years), and four (4) seats are for a term of 73 epochs (approximately one year). It is important for applicants to understand that by registering, they confirm their willingness and ability to serve for the longer term of up to 146 epochs, should they be elected to such a term through the selection process outlined below.

The assignment of these term lengths will be determined by the election results in the following manner:

* The candidate receiving the highest number of votes will have the first choice of selecting either a 146-epoch term or a 73-epoch term.
* The candidate with the second-highest number of votes will then make their selection from the remaining available term lengths.
* This process will continue sequentially for all seven elected candidates, based on their vote ranking from highest to lowest.
* If all terms of a particular length (e.g., all three 146-epoch terms) are selected before all candidates have chosen, the remaining elected candidates will automatically be assigned the other available term length until all seats are filled.

**Optional Tasks to Demonstrate Capabilities**

In addition to the main application requirements, candidates have the opportunity to undertake an optional three-step task. Completing this task allows applicants to demonstrate key skills relevant to the CC role: technical proficiency in credential management (Steps 1 & 2) and the analytical ability to evaluate governance actions within Cardano's framework (Step 3), all performed in the SanchoNet environment. The overall objective is to successfully generate cold credentials, authorize hot credentials using them, and then use the hot credentials to evaluate, vote on, and justify a position on a governance action on SanchoNet, submitting a URL to the required evidence.
