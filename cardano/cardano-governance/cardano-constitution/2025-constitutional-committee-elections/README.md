As the Cardano ecosystem continues its journey towards decentralized governance, a fully elected Constitutional Committee (CC) marks a big step. CC plays a crucial role in upholding the principles and rules outlined in the Cardano Constitution. We are excited to announce the official opening of the candidate registration period for candidates aspiring to serve on this vital committee.

Registration window:

Mark your calendars! Candidate registration will commence on May 5, 2025. The window for submitting candidacies will remain open until May 31, 2025, closing at noon UTC.

Who can register?

Participation is open to the entire Cardano community. Any owner of ada is eligible to join Intersect and put themselves forward as a candidate. This includes:

* Individuals
* Consortiums
* Companies.

This inclusive approach ensures that diverse perspectives and expertise from across the ecosystem can be represented within the committee.

Election and term structure:

Following the registration and subsequent election process, seven members will be selected to form the Constitutional Committee. To establish continuity and staggered terms, as mandated by the constitution, the elected candidates will serve terms of varying lengths:

* The top three elected candidates will be appointed for a two-year term.
* The remaining four elected candidates will serve a one-year term.

This structure ensures a blend of experience and fresh perspectives over time.

Eligibility of interim members:

All members currently serving on the interim Constitutional Committee are eligible and encouraged to register as candidates for the upcoming election. It is important to note that continued service on the committee requires successful re-election alongside all other candidates.

Candidate engagement opportunities:

To facilitate interaction between candidates and the broader Cardano community, Intersect will be hosting dedicated X Spaces. These sessions will provide a platform for candidates to introduce themselves, share their vision for Cardano's governance, and answer questions from the community. More details on the schedule for these Spaces will be announced shortly.

Furthermore, Intersect actively encourages and will support community-driven engagement initiatives hosted outside of its own channels. We believe a robust election process benefits from diverse platforms for discussion and debate, and we endorse efforts by the community to host candidate forums, debates, or Q\&A sessions.

Get your questions answered:

Understanding the process, the role of the CC, and the election mechanics is crucial. To ensure clarity, open Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) sessions are being hosted twice weekly by the CC election working group. These sessions are designed to address any questions potential candidates or community members may have. Please register [here](https://lu.ma/ccelection) for specific times for these AMA calls.

A call to participate:

This is a significant moment for Cardano governance. Serving on the Constitutional Committee offers a unique opportunity to contribute directly to the stewardship and evolution of the ecosystem. If you are an ada owner passionate about Cardano's principles and future direction, we strongly encourage you to consider registering as a candidate.

Let's work together to build a resilient and effective governance framework for Cardano.
