# Previous versions of the Cardano Constitution

### Versioning of the draft constitution

The first version of the draft constitution (not to be confused with the [interim](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-governance/cardano-constitution/interim-cardano-constitution) currently live on mainnet) was made available at the end of July 2024 and before the start of the workshop series. Following the conclusion of the series and 63 workshops with more than 1400 contributors, the Civics Committee began collating and adjusting the July version, resulting in seven additional delegate workshops to synthesise the collective feedback.
