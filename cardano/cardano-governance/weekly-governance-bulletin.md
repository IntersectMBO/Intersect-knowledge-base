## **Hard Fork Working Group Updates**

Intersect Technical Steering Committee, Hard fork working group, and Parameter Sub-committee propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang #2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10). Existing Plutus cost model settings will not be changed. Note that the primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork).
