Intersect is a member-based organization (MBO), which means the community is in charge of steering and organizing the future of Cardanoâ€™s blockchain. Anyone or any organization in the community can choose to join Intersect.

The board currently has five seats. IOG and EMURGO hold two. Wyoming State University holds the education seat; two seats are available for Intersect membership.

The committees are teams made up of people from the Cardano community. They steer and provide recommendations on behalf of the community at large.&#x20;

Since Intersect was established in January 2024, the committees have been staffed by initial volunteers, Intersect administration, and seed funding organization resources. They have helped us progress and have helped us achieve a stable position. Thanks to them, we are now at a phase of maturity where we can take the next step and ask the membership community to apply for these seats and elect their committee members to allow us to continue striving forward. &#x20;

## Upcoming elections - September and October 2024

To maintain momentum, we will take a phased approach. Some of the committee seats will be elected at one or more annual members meetings (AMM), and a second election will be held on April 25, 2025 to fill the remaining committee seats.
