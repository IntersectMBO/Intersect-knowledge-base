# Intersect 2026 Goals

Intersect’s 2026 goals focus on the areas where the organization provides the most essential value to Cardano: coordinating critical governance processes, enabling member-led delivery, and acting as a transparent and reliable administrator of community funds.

These goals recognise the scale of what lies ahead, the many unknowns still emerging in Cardano’s decentralized governance model, and the need to pioneer solutions together with the community. They provide clear direction without assuming central authority, and they reflect Intersect’s commitment to service, transparency and predictable delivery as Cardano continues to mature.

## 1. Governance and technical coordination <a href="#id-1.-governance-and-technical-coordination" id="id-1.-governance-and-technical-coordination"></a>
