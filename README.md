# What is Intersect?

Intersect is a member-based organization tasked with ensuring the Cardano ecosystem's continuity and future development. Bringing members together behind a shared vision, Intersect enables a more resilient, secure, transparent, and innovative ecosystem that puts members in the driving seat of Cardano’s future.

## Intersect Purpose

Cardano’s strength lies in its community’s ability to self-organize. Intersect exists to help coordinate efforts to address the most significant needs in Cardano today that require consensus, facilitating essential functions that have no single owner but are critical for the network’s progress.&#x20;

We create shared understanding, standards, and shared direction, reducing fragmentation and competing interests.

We ensure these processes are transparent, participatory, and result in actionable outcomes, maintaining momentum, keeping Cardano open and community-led throughout.  

## Intersect Mission

_(What do we do, for who and in what distinct way)_

Through coordination of member's expertise and effort, we help address the most significant needs in Cardano ecosystem.

<summary>Mission - Explanation</summary>

We provide impartial coordination of decentralised processes in blockchain ecosystems governed by their communities, specifically Cardano, guiding them to tangible outcomes (channeling effort to outcomes). We do this by helping people find commonalities, by proposing transparent standards for anyone who would like to actively provide value, leveraging a distributed global membership to reach consensus. (We help define open standards not rigid gated processes)

We support specialized member driven groups to coordinate and focus effort on areas that drive the ecosystem positive evolution.

We aim to provide the clearest and easiest entry point to participate and advance Cardano, and get value from it as a blockchain ecosystem governed by its community. We do this by acting as a reliable entity to look at when something important, that needs community participation and consensus, is happening or about to happen, and by making it easy to discover and use Cardano services provided by the ecosystem.

Through our innovative organizational structure we also help bridge and operationalize Cardano’s constitutional principles harnessing the power of the decentralised treasury and potential to the real world. We provide oversight via transparent on-chain reporting back to Cardano’s community.

## **Our values**

### Cardano first

We prioritize Cardano’s infrastructure and ecosystem in all our endeavors. This means Cardano’s core ethos remains very much at the heart of our DNA. It also means we advocate for and support Cardano projects, builders, founders, and all ecosystem participants ahead of alternatives. When opportunities arise—such as open positions or collaborations—we first look to our community members. We are committed to supporting the ecosystem first and foremost, and scaling through our members to ensure that Cardano thrives from within.

### Transparency

Transparency is at the root of all our processes and decisions. We operate with both implicit and explicit consent from our members, ensuring that oversight and scrutiny are integral parts of our governance. By being open about our actions and decisions, we build trust within the community and enable members to be fully informed participants in shaping Cardano's future.

### Servant leadership

We believe in leading by serving. Collaboration is key, and we work hand-in-hand with our members, committees, working groups, and all stakeholders. We actively listen to our members and our elected committees at every turn, making ourselves as approachable, open, and available as possible. Our internal ways of working are rooted in supporting others to achieve their goals, fostering a cooperative environment where everyone's contributions are valued.

### Inform, not dictate

Our role is to inform and empower, not dictate. We provide the resources, information, and support necessary for progress, while recognizing that our members ultimately deliver it. By enabling informed decision-making, we achieve better on-chain outcomes and ensure that the direction of Cardano is shaped by those who are most invested in its success.
