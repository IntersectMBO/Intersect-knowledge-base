# What is Intersect

Intersect is a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem tasked with ensuring its continuity and future development. Bringing members together behind a shared vision, Intersect enables a more resilient, secure, transparent, and innovative Cardano ecosystem that puts members in the driving seat of Cardano’s future.

## **Intersect's five pillars**

At its core, Intersect will focus on ensuring, through its members, the future maintenance and development of Cardano. As a community governed blockchain, this means caring about both the technology and processes that enable technical progress and consensus through discourse and collaboration.

Intersect has five pillars:

1. Support the **community** to develop the ecosystem by hosting developer-focused conferences, hackathons, and events.
2. Administrate and champion Cardano’s **community-led governance** implemented by CIP 1694.
3. Orchestrate delivery of the community approved **Cardano Technical Roadmap.**
4. Facilitate the continuity of Cardano for system stability.
5. Coordinate open source **development** of core technologies for Cardano.
