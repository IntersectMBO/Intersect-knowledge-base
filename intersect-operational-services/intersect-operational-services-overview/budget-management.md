# Budget Management

[The Budget Committee](https://budgetcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/) is responsible for ensuring that the community-approved budget is effectively managed, tracked, and delivered according to mandates. While they oversee these budgets, Intersectâ€™s Core Services team handles the operational day-to-day expenditures. Their key responsibilities include:

* **Budget Sheet Management**: Each committee has a dedicated budget sheet tracking expenditures.
* **Procurement & Delivery Tracking**: Monitoring each phase of contract completion.
* **Legal & Invoicing Support**: Managing contracts, invoicing, and financial documentation.
* **Forecasting & Reporting**: Ensuring transparency and financial accountability.

Cardano Development Holdings (CDH) operates a pool of funds for use to benefit the Cardano blockchain and the development of the Cardano ecosystem. All project funding will come from the CDH with Intersect appointed to administer the funds on its behalf.

Below is a diagram showing how the Committee's budgets will be managed:

## Financial Transparency <a href="#financial-transparency" id="financial-transparency"></a>

To ensure transparency, Intersect has proposed a quarterly meeting be held with the CC/DReps. At these meetings, the Committees, supported by Intersect Core Services, would walk the audience through the financial details and value delivered during the period.
