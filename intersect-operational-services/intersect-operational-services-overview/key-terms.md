# Key Terms

* [Intersect Operational Services](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-operational-services/intersect-operational-services-overview): Intersect’s Operational Services support committee projects by managing the procurement process and overseeing the budget. Our approach ensures compliance, transparency, and effective resource management, enabling committees to focus on their objectives.
* Proposal: A proposal is less specific than a tender. The Committee issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) when they have a clear idea of what they want to achieve but rely on the expertise, creativity, and innovation of the vendor/supplier to define the scope of work. The proposal identifies the problem or business opportunity, defines the solution, methodology, project plan, pricing, and organizational credentials.&#x20;
* [Committee Requirement Document (CRD)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ti6H1iHFrh82aO206mO6Z2XexGJv2fo_PIXmKbZF5U/edit?tab=t.0): Committees will request this document to submit their requirements to Operational Services for work they’d like to propose out to the Community.
* Request For Information (RFI): An RFI is a formal solicitation from Intersect Operational Services to its members and the broader community seeking expressions of interest or information.
* Request For Proposal (RFP): an RFP is the “call for proposal” from Intersect Operational Services to its members and the broader community, asking them to supply a proposal to the requirement.
* [Milestone Acceptance Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpZKribSu97mXYPQtl7SQAIApdYCoKjBeU2LjbmCaqk/edit?tab=t.0): The Milestone Acceptance form is a document to confirm that a specific project milestone has been completed and accepted by the Committee and Intersect. It records that the deliverables meet the agreed-upon criteria before proceeding to the next phase.
