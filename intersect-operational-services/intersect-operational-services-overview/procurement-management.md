# Procurement Management

If a proposal has been approved by DReps, pushed through to successful treasury withdrawal and the vendor selected Intersect to be the named administrator then Intersect Operational Services team will oversee the procurement process.&#x20;

We will support from contract creation to contract initiation including any legal and financial requirements to consider. We will work closely with each vendor to ensure clear communication, tracking, and timely project delivery.
