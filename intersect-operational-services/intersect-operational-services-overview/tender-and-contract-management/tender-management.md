_Please note that this process can be tailored to the requirements of the committee and will be iterated and optimized as we progress._

## Timeline (8-10 weeks)

The average timeline from the call to tender to contract award is 8-10 weeks.&#x20;

* 2 weeks to gather requirements, build the application form, set the evaluation criteria, agree on the reviewers and open tender (step 1-3)
