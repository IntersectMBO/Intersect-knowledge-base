# Considerations

When thinking about applying for this grant, responses to the brief should consider how the Proposal Discussion Forum could surface proposals before they become governance actions. Stages such as:

1. Proposal submission
2. Proposal discussion
3. Proposal polling&#x20;

The features that you could include under each area is under your creative direction. To help, [this is an overall flow map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LtwxQ9it\_8yb10LS2kd4jPIq2Locq5FB/view?usp=sharing), highlighting the key steps that the Proposal Discussion Forum will need to support.

### Expected cost range

There is no set amount for this grant, as we would prefer applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution, allowing for a broader range of creativity and ambition. However, as a steer, we expect the costs to fall between 90,000 - 180,000 ADA. _Note that you may still propose outside of this range with strong rationale._
