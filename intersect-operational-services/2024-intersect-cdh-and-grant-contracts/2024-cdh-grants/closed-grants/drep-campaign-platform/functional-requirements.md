# Functional requirements

* Enable DReps to create profiles showcasing and highlighting their role in Cardano, and their perspectives on governance
* Facilitate the DRep delegation process (for example, by linking to the unique on-chain identifier for a DRep)
* Align with the [CIP-0100? | Governance Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556) to structure the extra content DReps will provide
* Implement wallet connect functionality over CIP-30 and CIP-95 to identify and verify DReps and delegators from their wallet
* Allow DReps to update their metadata (additional context about them)
* Allow DReps to provide updates to the ada holders who delegated to them
