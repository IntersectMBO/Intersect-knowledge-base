# Considerations

### Expected cost range

There is no set amount for this award, as itâ€™d be preferable for applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution, allowing for a broader range of creativity. However, to help applicants sense-check their proposal, the costs would be expected to be in the range of 90,000 - 180,000 ada. Proposals outside this range with a valid reasoning will also be considered.

### Suggested minimum milestones

The milestones below are indicative and proposals should ideally not exceed a six month delivery plan. Proposals should also broadly align with the [CIP-1694 roadmap](https://www.intersectmbo.org/roadmap).&#x20;
