# Considerations

### Expected cost range

There is no set amount for this award, as we would prefer applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution, allowing for a broader range of creativity.  However, to help applicants sense-check their proposal, we expect the costs to fall in the range of 60,000 - 120,000 ada. Note that you may still propose outside of this range with valid reasoning.

### Suggested minimum milestones

The milestones below are indicative and proposals should ideally not exceed a six month delivery plan. Proposals should also broadly align with the [CIP-1694 roadmap](https://www.intersectmbo.org/roadmap).&#x20;
