# If your project is delayed

We know sometimes delays happen, but if your project, or a specific milestone, is delayed the grantee is required, as soon as possible, to inform the Grants team. Let us know the reason for delay and any associated dependancies via [grants@intersectmbo.org](mailto:grants@intersectmbo.org). We can look to renegotiate delivery times and associated payments if required.
