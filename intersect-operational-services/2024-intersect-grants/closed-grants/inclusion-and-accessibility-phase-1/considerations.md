# Considerations

### Collaboration

Because localisation efforts need to happen across the entire governance process and across many cultures, collaboration could be helpful to ensure full coverage. Proposers are encouraged to collaborate with other members where helpful, or to collaborate with tool builders to integrate the localisation work if applicable.

### Non-technical proposals

Some of the proposals in this category may not require software development. As you are applying, please respond to questions based on their intent. When asked to provide features of your solution, explain its main components. For the planned technical features and implementation, please explain what tools and platforms you will be using to bring your solution to life. When providing information about the plan for testing, updates, and maintenance, please explain how the solution will be kept updated as the Cardano governance system and tools evolve.
