# Intersect Stake-Based Voting Tool

Intersect, a community-driven organization dedicated to supporting the Cardano ecosystem, requires a robust and versatile voting tool to facilitate stake-based voting events throughout the year. These processes include Constitutional Committee elections.

We're seeking a community builder to repurpose an existing open-source voting tool to be used for various stake-based voting events, starting with the upcoming Constitutional Committee (CC) elections in Q2 2025. The expected outcome is to have a reusable solution - accessible to the entire ecosystem and adaptable to current and future needs.

By issuing this tender, Intersect aims to leverage the expertise of community builders to customize an existing open-source voting tool, ensuring it aligns with Intersect's present and future voting requirements.

### Project Scope:

Develop an open-source voting tool based on an existing open-source platform, customized to meet the following requirements:

#### Key Requirements:

* Foundation: Existing open-source voting platform (e.g., [Cardano Ballot](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot)).
* Customization: Adaptable to various voting scenarios.
* Voting Types: Support for:
  * Simple Majority
  * Simple Majority Multi-Selection
  * Ranked Choice
* Security & Transparency: Secure and transparent voting process.
* Open Source: Final product must be open source for use within the Cardano ecosystem.

By fulfilling these requirements, the chosen community builder will empower Intersect and the broader Cardano community with a valuable tool for democratic governance and decision-making.

#### Deliverables:

* Functional and documented voting tool.
* Open-source code repository.
