# Intersect Stake-Based Voting Tool

## Introduction

### Context:

Intersect, a community-driven organization dedicated to supporting the Cardano ecosystem, requires a robust and versatile voting tool to facilitate stake-based voting events throughout the year. These processes include Constitutional Committee elections.

### Why this tender is required:

Starting from the CC elections, which would be a regular event, Intersect needs a reusable solution for stake-based voting. By issuing this tender, Intersect aims to leverage the expertise of community builders to customize an existing open-source voting tool, ensuring it aligns with Intersect's present and future voting requirements.

### Desired Outcome:

The ideal outcome of this tender is a user-friendly, secure, and adaptable open-source voting tool that can be readily deployed for voting events within the Cardano community. The tool should be:

* **Based on an existing open-source platform** (ex. [Cardano Ballot](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cardano-ballot)): This will ensure a solid foundation, minimize development time, and avoid adding another voting tool to the ecosystem.
* **Customizable:** The tool should be easily adaptable to different voting scenarios, including varying electorates, candidate slates, and voting mechanisms. It should support different types of voting types such as simple majority, simple majority multiselection voting, ranked choice, threshold
* **Secure and Transparent:** The voting process must be secure and transparent, ensuring the integrity of the results and maintaining voter confidence.
* **Open Source:** The final product should remain open source, allowing other organizations and communities within the Cardano ecosystem to benefit from and contribute to its development.\


By fulfilling these requirements, the chosen community builder will empower Intersect and the broader Cardano community with a valuable tool for democratic governance and decision-making.
