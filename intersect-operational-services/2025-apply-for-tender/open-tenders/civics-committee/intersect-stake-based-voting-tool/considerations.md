# Considerations

## Expected cost range

There is no set amount for this award, as we would prefer applicants to specify the amount needed to implement their proposed solution, allowing for a broader range of creativity. However, to help applicants sense-check their proposal, we expect the costs to fall in the range of 40,000 - 60,000 dollars. Note that you may still propose outside of this range with valid reasoning. Consideration for value for money will be taken into account during the evaluation.
