# Open Tenders

Due to the treasury withdrawal being delayed until mid-2025 (as per budget process), we have limited funds to distribute to the Cardano ecosystem and any tenders that open prior to the budget availability have been identified as our high priority and agreed between Intersect Committees and Operational Services.

Tender will be listed by Intersect Committee in the pages that follow:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
* Product Committee
* Open Source Committee (OSC)
* Civics Committee
* Membership and Community Committee (MCC)
* Budget Committee
