# Open RFPs

Due to the treasury withdrawal being delayed until mid-2025 (as per budget process), we have limited funds to distribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Any RFPs that open prior to the budget availability have been identified as high priority and agreed on between Intersect Committees and Operational Services.

Tenders will be listed by Intersect Committee in the pages that follow:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
* Product Committee
* Open Source Committee (OSC)
* Civics Committee
* Membership and Community Committee (MCC)
* Budget Committee
