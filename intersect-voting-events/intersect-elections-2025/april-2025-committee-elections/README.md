# April 2025 - Committee elections

## Committee elections

Intersect is a member-based organization (MBO), which means the community is in charge of steering and organizing the future of Cardano’s blockchain. Anyone or any organization in the community can choose to join Intersect.

The board currently has five seats. IOG and EMURGO hold two. Wyoming State University holds the education seat; two seats are available for Intersect membership.

The committees are teams made up of people from the Cardano community. They steer and provide recommendations on behalf of the community at large.

In October 2024, the first elections selected half of the committee members. Now, in this second election, the remaining seats will be filled—completing the committees and strengthening community-led governance for the year ahead.

## Eligibility
