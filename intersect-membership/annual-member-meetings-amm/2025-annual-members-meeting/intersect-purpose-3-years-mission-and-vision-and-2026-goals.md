## About Intersect

### Where does Intersect fit in Cardano’s bigger picture

Key references to constitution

* TENET 9: All users of the Cardano Blockchain shall be treated fairly and impartially, taking into account the collective desires of the Cardano Blockchain Community, consistent with the long-term sustainability and viability of the Cardano Blockchain.
* Article II - Section 2: Participants in the Cardano Community who own ada are entitled to access and participate in the on-chain decision-making processes of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, including voting and taking part in on-chain governance actions regarding the Cardano Blockchain.
* Article II - Section 3: The Cardano Community has a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem by following this Constitution, operating the Cardano Blockchain, participating in Cardano Blockchain governance activities, and resolving disputes in a fair and transparent manner.
* Article II - Section 6: The Cardano Community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing administration of off-chain governance processes as may be necessary to give effect to this Constitution and to ensure that there is awareness of and an opportunity to debate and shape all future governance actions for the Cardano Blockchain.

Cardano was founded on cypherpunk values: decentralization, transparency, and the conviction that individuals and communities should have power over the systems they rely on. These principles are not abstract ideals, they are lived through the way the network is governed and evolves. It also does not imply a void of structure, but a structure shaped and upheld by the people who participate in it.

Since Cardano entered the age of Voltaire and governance moved from a handful of organizations to the broader community, the need for processes that support decentralized decision-making has become both clear and urgent.

While a constitution and on-chain voting provide the formal structure, a third element is emerging: voluntary, community-aligned coordination.

Coordination and consolidation of processes are critical to allow distributed decision making to work efficiently and effectively, especially in a global ecosystem like Cardano.



### Intersect Purpose: Why does Intersect need to exist

Cardano’s strength lies in its community’s ability to self-organize. Intersect exists to help coordinate efforts to address the most significant needs in Cardano today that require consensus, facilitating essential functions that have no single owner but are critical for the network’s progress.&#x20;

We create shared understanding, standards, and shared direction, reducing fragmentation and competing interests.

We ensure these processes are transparent, participatory, and result in actionable outcomes, maintaining momentum, keeping Cardano open and community-led throughout.  

### Intersect Mission: What do we do, for who and in what distinct way

(This is how we aim to achieve our purpose and reach our vision over the 3 years)

#### Mission - One summary sentence

Through coordination of member's expertise and effort, we help address the most significant needs in Cardano ecosystem

#### Mission -Explanation

We provide impartial coordination of decentralised processes in blockchain ecosystems governed by their communities, specifically Cardano, guiding them to tangible outcomes (channeling effort to outcomes). We do this by helping people find commonalities, by proposing transparent standards for anyone who would like to actively provide value, leveraging a distributed global membership to reach consensus. (We help define open standards not rigid gated processes)

We support specialized member driven groups to coordinate and focus effort on areas that drive the ecosystem positive evolution.

We aim to provide the clearest and easiest entry point to participate and advance Cardano, and get value from it as a blockchain ecosystem governed by its community. We do this by acting as a reliable entity to look at when something important, that needs community participation and consensus, is happening or about to happen, and by making it easy to discover and use Cardano services provided by the ecosystem.

Through our innovative organizational structure we also help bridge and operationalize Cardano’s constitutional principles harnessing the power of the decentralised treasury and potential to the real world. We provide oversight via transparent on-chain reporting back to Cardano’s community.

### Intersect 3 years Vision: Where will Intersect be if we pursue what we do successfully

(this is where will be in 3 years if we followed successfully our Mission)

* Processes that are critical to Cardano are standardized, coordinated by at least one body with clear community support, and have easy paths for open participation. In particular key process currently supported by Intersect are:
  * Cardano Budget Process
  * Cardano long term vision and yearly roadmap process
  * Cardano Constitutional refinements process
  * Cardano Hard Forks process
  * Cardano Open Source processes
* Intersect is a trusted coordination points between multiple specialised member driven groups, internal or external to Intersect
* New and existing members of the Cardano community use Intersect to understand how to contribute to and take value from the Cardano ecosystem, that being via Intersect itself or via other organizations Intersect coordinates with
* Intersect administered with transparency and clear delivery assurance 5 yearly budgets for Cardano key proposals, establishing itself as a trusted entity that enables Cardano’s treasury value

### Intersect 10 years Vision: Where do we aspire Intersect, its members and Cardano (and the world) to be if we keep progressing in this path

The foundation for a world governed in harmony by the people.

Cardano’s decentralised governance is the most advanced example for the world of coordinated human constructive collaboration towards a shared better future. Intersect’s coordination of individuals and organizations has created a strong self-supporting culture for individuals to work together.

## 2026 Goals

Intersect’s 2026 goals focus on the areas where the organization provides the most essential value to Cardano: coordinating critical governance processes, enabling member-led delivery, and acting as a transparent and reliable administrator of community funds.&#x20;

These goals recognise the scale of what lies ahead, the many unknowns still emerging in Cardano’s decentralized governance model, and the need to pioneer solutions together with the community. They provide clear direction without assuming central authority, and they reflect Intersect’s commitment to service, transparency and predictable delivery as Cardano continues to mature.

## Intersect’s key principles

* **Cardano first**: We prioritize Cardano’s infrastructure and ecosystem in all our endeavors. This means Cardano’s core ethos remains very much at the heart of our DNA. It also means we advocate for and support Cardano projects, builders, founders, and all ecosystem participants ahead of alternatives. When opportunities arise—such as open positions or collaborations—we first look to our community members. We are committed to supporting the ecosystem first and foremost, and scaling through our members to ensure that Cardano thrives from within.
* **Transparency**: We operate in the open, with clear communication.\
  Transparency is at the root of all our processes and decisions. We operate with both implicit and explicit consent from our members, ensuring that oversight and scrutiny are integral parts of our governance. By being open about our actions and decisions, we build trust within the community and enable members to be fully informed participants in shaping Cardano's future.
* **Servant leadership**: We believe in leading by serving. Collaboration is key, and we work hand-in-hand with our members, committees, working groups, and all stakeholders. We actively listen to our members and our elected committees at every turn, making ourselves as approachable, open, and available as possible. Our internal ways of working are rooted in supporting others to achieve their goals, fostering a cooperative environment where everyone's contributions are valued.
* **Inclusivity**: Anyone can participate meaningfully and our culture actively fosters this.
* **Accountability**: We set standards and keep ourselves and others to them.
* **Collaboration**: We connect people, find consensus, and channel effort.
* **Impartiality**: We act in the community’s best interest, not as a gatekeeper.
* **Execution**: We deliver, not just discuss.
* Shared ownership: Our organization is owned and directed by the many
* Participation: We keep participation open and easy
* Collective voice - Greater influence: We join our member voice to give them greater influence (or impact)

## How does Intersect’s structure contribute?

### Member based organization - our members

Cardano on-chain governance needs off-chain discussion and coordination to properly serve the people. We are a member-based organization (MBO) because our mission and value depend on collective ownership, shared governance, and community participation.&#x20;

* Members aren’t just customers or beneficiaries, they are stakeholders.
* Members bring diverse perspectives, expertise, and lived experiences. Better problem-solving, more representative governance, and fewer blind spots in decision-making.
* The organization exists to serve its members, not to maximize profit or external shareholder value. So incentives stay aligned with the long-term goals of the community.
* A member-based structure amplifies collective advocacy. The organization can influence policy, standards, or industry direction with the weight of its membership behind it.
* We give voices to each members via our one-member-one-vote voting&#x20;



Intersect is simply an aggregation and coordination point. Without the people, who have the expertise, who are interested and passionate about making Cardano better, Intersect can’t provide any value. So Intersect as an organization needs to ensure its structure is easy to navigate and use, so that these people can connect their effort and provide value to the ecosystem.

Intersect members have the right to vote who sit in which committee and on the Intersect board, so deciding who has the right expertise for the task. Members, via their discussions and work, are the one providing the recommendations to bring Cardano, and Intersect with it, forward, playing a critical role in the ecosystem. Without their effort, today the Cardano ecosystem would not even have the right to self-govern.



### Committees and working groups

(WGs and Committees broad framework, how do they act and evolve, what role do they play)

In Intersect, we open paths for participation to any contributor, from the least committed one who has little time to those who take on critical roles. We do this via options for participation related to detailed subjects.

\
Working groups, which can be created by any member or directly via the committees, are the core places where hands-on work happens, where detailed proposals are created, and where members and associates alike, as well as external contributors, can come together with a common task.&#x20;

Committees are the formal member-elected bodies, where voting members represent Intersect as an organization in relation to the remit they have assigned. They discuss the broader needs of the Cardano ecosystem to arrive at a proposed solution, which could lead to a formal proposal in Cardano’s on-chain’s governance. To do this they meet regularly, work hands-on or might create dedicated working groups, and ultimately they vote on what proposal to bring forward.

When the membership or the Intersect sees a new need emerging, they might propose or decide to promote a working group to be an elected committee, or create a working group with the purpose of creating a new committee. As the ecosystem evolves, and committees get dedicated funding to work on the specific need they support, committees might evolve into their own MBOs (see details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nVXPE4e2eW8fyG629dTnVWBpuWgP1GwZgTHT0hgPF6w/edit?tab=t.79afdnfqkyc3))

### Membership

(Membership, community hubs what role they play)

Intersect membership provides different levels of commitments to the effort members want to give to Cardano. Within the Wyoming structure, it ensures voting rights, and so direct decision making, for Members.

The different membership tiers, and the free associate subscription, give participants with different needs, a set of dedicated benefits to better provide their contribution to Cardano. For example, individual membership allows individual contributors to actively participate in discussions, elections and seating in committees and Board. Enterprise membership allows members to show Cardano’s value via their services, and gives them an explicit say in Cardano’s direction, and so more control over their business core stack. Educational membership allows institutions to bring academic expertise to the conversation while onboarding new people to Cardano.

#### Community hubs

Intersect community hubs, act as the regional hearts of Intersect. They are the place where a remote global community becomes a local one, where members can connect and discuss in-person the dedicated needs and opportunities for their region.
