# 2025 Annual Members Meeting

The Annual Members Meeting happened on November 29, 2025. It was entirely virtual, bringing the global community together to celebrate achievements and look ahead to what's next.

To enable global membership to participate and connect, Intersect partnered with Clay Nation, which created a virtual environment where members could meet, discuss, and celebrate their shared 2025 achievements.

The meeting lasted 24 hours to accommodate members across 12 time zones. While some in-person satellite gatherings were held around the world, the main event was in the Virtual Hub.
