# Technical & Troubleshooting Questions

1. **The Virtual Hub isn’t loading, what should I do?**

* Refresh the page.
* Close other tabs or apps using high memory (e.g., Zoom).
* Confirm you’re using a supported browser like Chrome or Edge.
* Try opening the link in an incognito window.



2. &#x20;**My microphone isn’t working, how can I fix it?**

* Check your browser permissions (Chrome ➝ padlock icon ➝ Allow mic access).
* Ensure no other app is using the microphone.
* Refresh once permissions are updated.
* Test your mic using your computer’s audio settings.



3. &#x20;**I can’t hear anyone, what should I check?**

* Verify your output device (headphones, speakers) is selected.
* Make sure your browser tab isn’t muted.



4. &#x20;**My avatar isn’t moving or controls are slow. What can I do?**

* Check your internet speed (minimum 10 Mbps recommended).
* Switch from Wi-Fi to a wired connection if possible.
* Close heavy applications or browser tabs.
* Refresh the platform to reset lag.



5. &#x20;**The proximity audio feels inconsistent—why?**\
   Proximity audio adjusts based on where you are in the space. If it feels unstable:

* Stay within the intended conversation circle.
* Try moving closer to the person you want to hear.





6. **What if I get disconnected?**\
   If you get disconnected or refresh the page, you can rejoin using the same event link. You will be automatically redirected back into the main room, and you won’t lose access to the event. However, if you were inside a private room or in a specific location in the space, you may need to navigate back to that spot after re-entering.



7. &#x20;**How do I report a bug during the event?**\
   Click the **Help** button inside the Hub or message the Intersect support team via the event chat.
