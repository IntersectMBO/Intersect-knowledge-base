# Open Source committee (OSC)

Intersect’s Open Source Committee fosters the development and evolution of Cardano as a community-led, decentralized open-source project. Our mission is to support the growth of Cardano through community-driven decision-making. By delivering essential tools, establishing clear policies, and providing expert guidance, we ensure Cardano remains adaptive, accessible, and positioned for long-term success.
