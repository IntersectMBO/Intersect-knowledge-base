# Membership and Community committee (MCC)

## What is the Membership and Community Committee?

The Membership and Community Committee (MCC) focuses on building a thriving Cardano community - from membership growth and member support to community tooling grants, educational initiatives, and events that foster meaningful connection and collaboration.

## Why is this committee important?

It devises strategies to engage community members, promote collaboration, and encourage meaningful contributions. By organizing events, forums, and online platforms, the committee creates spaces for interaction and knowledge-sharing among community participants.

## Which topics does this committee cover?

The MCC oversees membership within Intersect and, by doing so, ensures that each member has access to benefits and opportunities for fuller participation in Cardano’s growth and development. The MCC also reviews, accepts or rejects proposals for community Working Groups.

## How to join?

Send an email to [membership-and-community-committee@intersectmbo.org](mailto:membership-and-community-committee@intersectmbo.org) for inquiries or more information. Intersect holds regular committee elections in collaboration with the other committees (Civics, Open Source, etc) to fill MCC seats. The MCC hosts public meetings every four weeks, and all members of Intersect are invited to attend.  Intersect always communicates details on how to apply and vote well in advance of each election.
