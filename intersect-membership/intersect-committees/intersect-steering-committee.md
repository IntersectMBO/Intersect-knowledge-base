ISC is a member-driven governing body that oversees all standing committees and functions within Intersect. It enables effective collective decision-making and communication flows between the Intersect Board, committees, community representatives, and Functional Directors.

In turn, this drives Intersect's growth on behalf of the Intersect membership and the wider Cardano ecosystem.

## How to join?

Two members of the Intersect Steering Committee are directly elected in the Intersect committee elections in addition to the standing committee chairs and the functional directors of Intersect. Intersect always communicates details on how to apply and vote well in advance of each election.&#x20;
