# Intersect voting events

Intersect facilitates Cardano's governance as a member-based organization where the community defines and manages how the ecosystem evolves. Since its establishment, Intersect has progressively transitioned control to its membership through democratic elections, with members voting on a one-member, one-vote basis to fill key positions across committees, the board, and working groups. This ensures that Cardano's direction reflects the collective will of its community rather than centralized authority.
