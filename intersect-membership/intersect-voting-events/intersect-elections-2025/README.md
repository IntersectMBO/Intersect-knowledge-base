# 2025 - Intersect elections

As a member-based organization transparency and accountability are core values to how Intersect best serves the Cardano ecosystem. Elections are a core component of transparent representation, continuing to be a member-driven organization. Intersect was established in Wyoming at the end of 2023, and since then has been steered by members who raised their hands and got involved. Thank you to all those who stepped up as Founding Members and moved us forward during our first year.
