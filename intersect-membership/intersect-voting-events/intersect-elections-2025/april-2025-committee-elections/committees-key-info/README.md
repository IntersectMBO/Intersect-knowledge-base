# Committees key info

As a member-driven organization, Intersect empowers the community to shape the future of the Cardano blockchain. Our committees play a vital role in governance, strategy, and ecosystem development. To ensure transparent and effective representation, we invite community members to step forward and apply for a committee seat in the upcoming 2025 elections.
