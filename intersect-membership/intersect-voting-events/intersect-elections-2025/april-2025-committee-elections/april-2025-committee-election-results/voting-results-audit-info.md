# Voting Results - audit info

The audit for this election has been performed by DQuadrant.

The first review of the audit pointed out a some duplicate votes submitted due to a bug in the voting tool database. During peak time, the database speed allowed some members to submit more than one vote for the same candidate in the same voting event by clicking more than once on the voting button. Because it is one member one vote, it was easy and without risks to identify the duplicates and remove them from the results to get the correct counting (even if kept, those votes, in total 55, would have not changed the results).

For anyone who would like to audit autonomously the participation and the individual votes submitted below are the files with all the details:
