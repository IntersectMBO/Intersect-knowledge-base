# Application Form - Translations

We have translated the application form for the Intersect Committee elections into five different languages to ensure accessibility for a broader audience. The available languages include Spanish, French, Portuguese, Sinhala, and Japanese. This effort aims to encourage greater participation and inclusivity within the community by making the application process more accessible to non-English speakers.
