# Committees key info

As a member-driven organization, Intersect empowers the community to shape the future of the Cardano blockchain. Our committees play a vital role in governance, strategy, and ecosystem development. To ensure transparent and effective representation, we invite community members to step forward and apply for a committee seat in the upcoming 2025 elections.

We’ve created an **Application Pack** with detailed one-pagers for each committee, outlining their purpose and responsibilities. Download the pack, explore the opportunities, and decide where to make the biggest impact.

<summary>Intersect steering committee</summary>

**Committee overview**: The Intersect Steering Committee (ISC) is the place where committee chairs, elected community members, and the Intersect Executive team come together to integrate committee expertise, member feedback, and operational insight to help steer Intersect as a member-led organization.

The meetings are held weekly, following a bi-weekly cadence:

* **Intersect Governance Focus** - Led by the leadership team, focusing on the organisational strategy of Intersect.
* **Committee Focus** - Meetings are facilitated by the Committee Chairs, highlighting any specific committee initiatives, risks/issues, or updates etc.
