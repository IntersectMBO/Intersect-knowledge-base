# Voting Results - audit info

The audit of the Committee Elections was conducted by the DQuadrant team, following a rigorous verification process to ensure accuracy and integrity. This included validating the data integrity of the vote exports (CSV and JSON), checking that each vote record met the required schema fields, and confirming voter eligibility by verifying membership status and purchase dates relative to the registration snapshot. The team also reviewed the timing of all votes to ensure they fell within the authorized voting window. Finally, DQuadrant independently tallied all valid votes by candidate and reconciled their results with Intersect’s internal counts to confirm full alignment.
