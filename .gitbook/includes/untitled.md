In summary:

* Proposal submission: fill out the Intersect form. If submitted by March 31, the proposal appears in the first public release in Gov.Tools. Proposals are now submitted via [Cardano GovTool](https://gov.tools/budget_discussion) and appear immediately for community and DRep review.
* Community review: during April, the proposals undergo comment, AMA sessions, focus groups, and iterative feedback.
* Reconciliation events: likely in late April or early May (dates TBA), offering deeper collaborative review and final adjustments.
* Consolidation & single deposit: proposals that gain strong consensus with participating DReps, bundle together in a budget proposal, with one 100,000 ada deposit covering the package.
* On-chain vote: DReps give final approval or rejection.
* Funding & audits: approved proposals require one more on-chain vote for the treasury withdrawals and will be subject to audits and oversight.

The process is iterative, and will be adjusted to suit DRep needs. Even after a core set of proposals is funded, the Cardano community can introduce and vote on further proposals in subsequent cycles.
