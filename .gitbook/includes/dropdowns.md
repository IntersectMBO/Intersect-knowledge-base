<summary>How does info action relate to the Net Change Limit (NCL)? What if the NCL is lower than the proposed budget info action?</summary>

&#x20;The Budget Info Action proposes an aggregate allocation from the Treasury, but does not spend funds directly. Actual spending occurs later through Treasury Withdrawal Actions, which must comply with the active Net Change Limit (NCL) at the time they are submitted. The current NCL that is approved and active is set at 350m ada.

If the NCL is lower than the total budget approved in the Info Action, only withdrawals within the available NCL can proceed. The remaining proposals must wait until the NCL is increased or a future window opens. In this way, the NCL serves as a safeguard, ensuring that Treasury spending remains fiscally constrained, even if a larger budget has been approved.
